 ### Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_ERICH_KOCH_DESC:0 "Once Gauleiter of the Nazi Party in Prussia, Erich Koch was assigned as Reichskommissar of Ukraine shortly after the occupation and quickly became renowned for his brutality, even by the standards of the Nazi regime. Koch has famously been quoted as saying, "If I meet a Ukrainian worthy of being seated at my table, I must have him shot." Under his leadership, Germanization continued well into the fifties until it was interrupted by the beginning of the West Russian War and the collapse of the Reichsmark.\n\nAfter the end of the War, affairs in Ukraine were marked by Koch turning upon his erstwhile sponsor Martin Bormann, who had previously supported him over Alfred Rosenberg to be appointed Reichskommissar during initial colonization efforts in the forties. The extremely public confrontation in the Reichstag led to Koch moving towards the militarist lobby that has rallied around Hermann Göring. The Reichskommissariat Ukraine teeters on a precipice: the native Ukrainians are beginning to sharpen their knives in preparation for the day when they can rise up against the Germans, the German settlers are growing unhappy with Ukraine's backwardness, and the situation abroad continues to grimly march towards utter calamity. Even Koch's iron fist may not be enough to suppress the chaos of the coming days..."
 POLITICS_VOLODYMYR_KUBIYOVYCH_DESC:0 "An age of oppression, barbarism, and bloodshed has crushed the will of many men and women to take a stand against foreign imperialism, and even fewer ordinary people would dare openly call for independence. However, Volodymyr Kubiyovych is not most people, as a lifetime as a soldier, a geographer, and a politician has shown. However, the many lifestyles of and bureaucracy surrounding Kubiyovych will not stand in the way of the one, true goal which has always persisted in the mind of the Polish-raised Ukranian, with the image of cheering Ukranians in a free state of their own.\n\nA life of study and teaching would not prepare the intellectual for the Nazi invasion of the Polish land he had lived in for most of his life, spurned by diaspora and, now, another invader of his home. Thus, Kubiyovych delved into the fire of his scorn to establish one of the few social programs on the face of Europe, helping thousands of Ukranian men, women, and children affected by the war. Meanwhile, the former cartographer chose to stand against the infamous Hans Frank in his desired slaughter of Ukranian peasants, allowing just a bit more success for his homeless people. However, as the Nazi victory came, all Kubiyovych could do was encourage the growth of the Galician Waffen-SS to use as a foundation for a pseudo-army to protect against further Nazi persecution.\n\nHowever, in the age of darkness Ukraine has found itself in, a light dawns on the horizon for Kubiyovych and his companions. Men may stand against him, clawing at him to strike down his attempts for independence. But such botherations and sins against the Ukranian people shall not stand against Kubiyovych's work with the Reich. Nothing will."
 POLITICS_PIETER_SCHELTE_HEEREMA_DESC:0 "Every decent family knows that you keep an extra bottle of your wine for when the situation absolutely demands it. For the German authority in Ukraine, Pieter Schelte Heerema is that extra bottle.\n\nA Dutchman from Amsterdam, Heerema was quick to collaborate with the Germans, joining the Waffen-SS in 1940. During his tenure, he helped establish and lead the Nederlandsche Oost Compagnie, which organized the Dutch settlement of the Reich's eastner territories during the war. It is through this channel that Heerema found himself in RK Ukraine by the war's end, helping in the administrative efforts of the colony.\n\nAfter the failure of the West Russian War, and the attempted SS coup in Germania, Heerema began to distance himself more and more from Himmler and the organization, while still officially retaining his SS title. Through his colonial and SS connections, he was able to ascend the ladder of the RK, all while managing to profit off of the 'rightful Germanization of the land'.\n\nNow that Ukraine, along with the rest of the Reich really, has gone into disrepair, the Reichstag has found a suitable safety candidate in Heerema. If he cannot improve conditions in the RK, he can at least keep them steady."

 UKR_breadbasket_of_the_reich_desc:0 "Since the Reich's great triumph in the east, Ukraine has been the breadbasket of the Reich and its allies in the Pakt. A great deal of the administration's budget comes from it's massive amounts of agricultural exports. While this has allowed Ukraine to remain somewhat economically self-sufficient, the trade has hampered our industrial development in other sectors.\n\nUkraine is hopelessly dependent on its agricultural exports. With so little diversification in other economic sectors, a crash in the agricultural market could spell doom for the Reichskommissariat's economy."

A great deal of the administration's budget comes from it's massive amounts of agricultural exports. While this has allowed Ukraine to remain somewhat economically self-sufficient, the trade has hampered our industrial development in other sectors.\n\nUnder the new Reich Administration, however, the Raga was reinstated, giving the Ukrainians considerably more lee-way to manage their matters. While somewhat less effective that other more authoritarian options, this will surely guide matters in a more §Gpacified matter.§!"

 UKR_partyzanschyna:0 "Partyzanshchyna"
 UKR_partyzanschyna_desc:0 "Even before the end of the Second World War, partisan groups of every ideology have run amuck throughout the countryside or lay hidden throughout our urban centers. The onset of the WRW has only emboldened local dissidents; guerilla warfare has since become an accepted way of life in rural regions.\n\nTo compound the issue, locals have taken action themselves. A broad alliance of local Ukrainians, including Horlis's Republicans and the left United Front, have banded together to exert limited political influence all throughout the colony. It has gotten to the point where Ukrainians hold the ancient title of 'Ataman' in some of the more fringe regions with little oversight. If order is not restored, the situation could deteriorate even further."
 UKR_shroud_of_generalplan_ost:0 "Shroud of Generalplan Ost"
 UKR_shroud_of_generalplan_ost_desc:0 "Generalplan Ost has been, for lack of better words, a failure in Ukraine. The first Germanic settlers included enthusiastic veterans and their families, as well as a large number of Dutch and Nordic opportunists who flocked to the bountiful plains in pursuit of wealth and land.\n\nNeedless to say, encouraging a massive migration with no foresight has resulted in Germanization being a nearly complete failure in Ukraine. Our administrators were not ready to parcial out our new conquests, and next to no thought was given to the displaced natives or where they would be relocated to. Many wandered to the cities, which were not ready to deal with an influx of newcomers. The results have been catastrophic; natives live in what can only be described as squalid conditions, and the German settlers don't fare much better. With no capital to afford the trip back to Germany, the various settlers are stuck in Ukraine right alongside the natives. Only the urban-elite; the rich factory and land owners enjoy any luxuries, which further exacerbates tensions."
 UKR_land_of_contrasts:0 "Land of Contrasts"
 UKR_land_of_contrasts_desc:0 "Reichskommissariat Ukraine's administration is deeply divided and factionalized. The most influential of these groups, the German establishment, the Ukranian Collaborators, the local German Garrison and the industrialists all vie for domination in the administration. These groups do in fact share something; their mutual displeasure at Koch's governance.\n\nThough fractured for now, if the situation within the country were to drastically change, our administration may have more than just the natives to worry about."
