 VIN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Empire of Vietnam is a nation tearing itself apart at the seams. Since The Greater East Asian War ended Emperor Bao Dai and Prime Minister Diem have been jockeying for control in the capital, preventing any real reforms to the nation crippled by war. All while The Viet Minh and growing numbers of Japanese Settlers carve up the countryside. All these matters are made even worse by the nation's near total reliance on Japan in all matters of national security.\n\nWhatever was gained from independence has been snuffed out by this civil strife, and only a slight gust of wind is needed to bring it all down."

 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_BAO_DAI_DESC:0 "Bào Dai is a man haunted by could-have-beens; as a child, he was raised to the throne more or less by decree in the wake of his father's death, and his moves have been carefully planned by others for most of his life since then. Not much has improved significantly since the days of his youth; the puppet masters now speak Japanese rather than French, and the grain convoys go to Osaka and Nagoya rather than to Paris, but Vietnam still chafes under a foreign boot, and he with it. And he is powerless to stop it.\n\nAs emperor, Bảo Đại has grown increasingly autocratic in his rule, preferring to rule without the help of his council. Which is ironic, considering those he relies upon to do his bidding are themselves loyal more to their paymasters in Tokyo than to the Emperor. Most of the rest of the country is indifferent to his decrees in any case, as Vietnam churns with rebellious sentiment and insurgents, just as it did in the last days of French rule. Ho Chi Minh lurks in the shadows, ready to pounce, and the overlords wait for a misstep to justify further intrusion.\n\nBào Dai sees his present and yearns for lost futures, for the dream of an independent and strong Empire that died when the Japanese marched in. His regrets are Vietnam's own; but unlike him, Vietnam has a chance of forging its own path and making it out alive. Bào Dai knows that when the future comes for him, he will be swept away, just another cobweb in the dusty hall. It's not like he has a choice in the matter."
 POLITICS_HO_CHI_MINH_DESC:0 "The man called Ho Chí Minh by the world has been known as Nguyen Sinh Cung and Bác Ho - "Uncle Ho" - in addition to something between fifty and two-hundred other pseudonyms. Virtually nothing is known about his life other than that he was born in Central Vietnam in 1890, and that he was trained in Marxist politics in France and Russia. He is, however, known and grudgingly respected by all Vietnamese - even his enemies - as a polyglot and a competent poet, whose poems in the Chu Hán and Chu Quoc Ngu scripts make for easy reading and listening for nearly the whole realm.\n\nNow, on the other hand, they know something more about him than before. After more than two decades of struggle, first against the French, then against the Vichy French, and at last against the Japanese - all the same breed of imperialists, Ho knew quite well - Ho has at last succeeded. Having thrown Bảo Đại and his assorted fellow Japanese sycophants out by the seat of their pants, he is one of the first communists to break the grip of the supposedly undefeatable Greater East-Asian Sphere.\n\nNow, with Vietnam increasingly united behind him, the new President, sensing that he does not have too long left to live, gets to work to build the ideal country for the Vietnamese people: an agrarian state predicated upon the tenets of Communism. He knows that his nation is surrounded by enemies, reactionaries afraid of the enlightenment he has brought his people spreading and toppling them. But let them all beware - if they attack his nation, he and the Viet Cong that defeated the Japanese once are more than capable of making Vietnam's enemies pay terribly in blood and misery again."
 POLITICS_TRUONG_CHINH_DESC:0 "The man who now calls himself Truong Chinh was born as Dang Xuân Khu in the Red River Delta not far from Hà Noi in 1907. After twenty-nine years spent on a life journey that led him first towards socialism and later towards the communism of Ho Chí Minh, he took his current name - "Long March" in Vietnamese - to honor the Long March undertaken by Mao Zedong, who was later to be martyred fighting the Japanese imperialists.\n\nNow Ho Chí Minh is dead, and an at least temporary victory against the Japanese has been assured. His successor is the man who the Vietnamese communists were proud to refer to as the 'excellent student of Bác (Uncle) Ho' - Truong Chinh. His revolutionary credentials are impeccable, and his loyalty to Vietnam and the Communist Party never in doubt: he took pride in his devotion to Ho's ideals even though he did not always agree with them.\n\nWith control now fully in Truong's hands, and the loyalty of his party and nation more or less assured, Truong is freed to move forward with a somewhat changed ideological program: the main plans will be predicated upon a land reform inspired by Mao Zedong's writings combined with a Bolshevist interpretation of the anti-colonial movement.\n\nRegardless of his plans, Truong will give his predecessor every reason to be proud of him. This he swears on his honor and loyalty to the Revolution and to Vietnam."

 VIN_japanese_rubber_exports_desc:0 "Vietnam has become one of the largest rubber exporters in the Japanese sphere and we are often treated unfairly in order for them to capitalise."
 VIN_japanese_army:0 "Japanese Military Restrictions"
 VIN_japanese_army_desc:0 "Believing Vietnam to be a cauldron of nationalistic thoughts the Japanese administration banned the new Empire from controlling any form of armed forces. However, there have been talks throughout both Japan and Vietnam over lifting these restrictions if requested...."
 VIN_Crippling_Illiteracy:0 "Crippling Illiteracy"
 VIN_Crippling_Illiteracy_desc:0 "The French had little interest in education in Vietnam during it's time as a colony. Thus, the vast majority of the country suffers from mass illiteracy. The average Vietnamese citizen lacks even basic reading and writing skills. This situation cannot be allowed to last if we intend on reform."
