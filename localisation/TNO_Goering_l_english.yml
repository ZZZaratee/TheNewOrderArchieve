 POLITICS_HERMANN_GORING_DESC:0 "Göring once made a public challenge that if any Allied bomber dare reach the Reich that forever after he would be known as Hermann Meier. The success of Nazism in the World War proved his bluff wise, and Göring was soon sure to cut himself a piece of the great pie the victors greedily dove into once the Allies lie destroyed.\n\nUsing a mix of a somewhat political able mind and several excessive uses of blunt force, namely in the deployment of thugs, militias and 'patriots' to harass and drive off any threats to his power, Göring has centered himself as the sole politician in the Reich who truly listens to the pleas of the soldiery. Seeing no other way to power, he has surrounded himself by uniformed sycophants who have convinced the aging Führer that the only way for the Reich to prosperity would be through the utter destruction of its enemies.\n\nNow, Göring goose-step arm and arm on what many consider a rapid road to the destruction of the Reich. That is assuming he is soon stopped however, for one can only imagine what may happen once Göring sets his sights overseas..."
 POLITICS_ALBERT_BORMANN_DESC:0 "In a regime as prone to nepotism and corruption as the Reich's, one would naturally expect the brother of one of the top party officials to rise high in his own right regardless of competence. Albert Bormann would disagree. Despite being the brother of the head of the Parteikanzlei and one of the most powerful men in the Reich, Albert's chilly relationship with his elder sibling has ensured his lack of continued mobility into the upper ranks of the government. Still, the industrious former attache to the Führer is not without his own allies. Naturally, the man he once served as a go-between for the Heer, Adolf Hitler, was always fond of him, and it was really only with the late Führer's patronage that Albert escaped being sent off to rot in one of the farther-flung Reichskommissariats by his estranged brother.\n\nThe Führer's death threatened to upend all that. It would have, that is, had not the victor been the other main protector within the halls of the Reich's power: Hermann Göring, the darling of the militarists. It was this militarism that drew the official to the Reichsmarshall, along with the man's own considerable charm, something that Martin never really had. Now, Göring has found in the brother of one of his greatest foes a competent administrator, willing to carry out his orders without hesitation or mercy."
 GENERAL_OTTO_REMER_DESC:0 "§LBorn: 1912\nAge: 50\nBranch: Heer\nRank: Generaloberst\nIf Schörner is the butcher, Otto Ernst Remer is his bloody knife. As a young officer coming of age just before the rise of the Nazis, Remer devoted himself body and soul to the National Socialist cause. Remer served with distinction in the campaigns against Poland, the Balkans, and during Operation Barbarossa, eventually rising to a battalion command in the Grossdeutschland Division. Remer's crowning glory came when he was personally awarded Oak leaves to his Knight's Cross by no less than the Führer, Adolf Hitler, himself. Remer's unit served in the thickest fighting of the war, from the deep heart of Russia where the Union was finally broken to the hills of North England where war finally came to its close.\n\nIn the long years since then, Remer has steadily grown in his influence within the Wehrmacht, rapidly rising to become Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner's right hand man, and as a consequence, the second most powerful man in the militarist faction of the officer corps. While Remer does have a strong degree of respect for his fellow warmonger and direct superior, his loyalty truly lies only with whoever he believes furthers the cause of the ultimate global victory of National Socialism, and whomever he thinks can best support that goal with action.§!"
 GENERAL_FERDINAND_SCHORNER_DESC:0 "§LBorn: 1892\nAge: 70\nBranch: Heer\nRank: Generalfeldmarschal\nThey call him "Butcher", "Bloody Ferdinand", "Hound of War" and many other brutal sobriquets. He is content with the title of Generalfeldmarshcall. He is skilled in large scale operations involving hundreds of thousands of men, and he cares nothing for their individual lives. Ferdinand Schörner is a man loved by none and feared by all. In the West Russian War it was said, the chances of being hanged as a deserter was greater than the chance of death in combat. His sway in the military was more than proven when, following a brief coup attempt at the end of that war, Schörner found his prospects for power actually rising.\n\nA veteran of the First World War, Ferdinand would end up as one of the Führer's favorite commanders in the Second. In more recent times he has also cultivated a mutually beneficial partnership with Reichsmarschall Göring, the old ace lending his political capital to Schörner's requests in exchange for the loyalty of the militarist faction.\n\nStill, the old devil of the Eastern Front has his own designs for the future, ones that may or may not require any politician to be his master. His rivalry with the other star of the Wehrmacht, Hans Speidel, is one of the largest obstacles he has yet to be encountered. Only time will tell if he has finally met his match, or, as some fear, he is only a step away from achieving his own ambitions.§!"
 GENERAL_JOHANNES_STEINHOFF_DESC:0 "§LAmong the heroes of the Luftwaffe, there is one pilot who stands head and shoulders above almost all others: Johannes Steinhoff. One of the most experienced aces of all time, Steinhoff was one of the very few pilots on either side of the Second World War to survive from the war's start to its end, flying combat missions throughout. Even after suffering horrific burns following a disastrous accident while test piloting the ME262 jet prototype, Steinhoff was back in the skies as soon as the doctors cleared him. Not wanting to lose such a valuable asset, Hermann Göring assigned Steinhoff to the Luftwaffe's pilot academy, where he served as head instructor for several years. Steinhoff would fly again during the West Russian War, and when that conflict too had passed he had hoped to live out the rest of his days peacefully as a teacher. It was not to be however, as the Bürgerkrieg enveloped Germany, the ace was faced with a hard choice. Eventually, he chose to follow Hermann Göring, the appointed successor to the late Führer. This time, the Reichsmarshall had more than just an instructor's billet in mind for Steinhoff, and shortly after Göring's victory the old veteran found himself as the new Oberbefehlshaber der Luftwaffe.§!"
 GGR_Artur_Axmann_for_desc:0 "------------\n§LArtur Axmann is considered one of the first politicians wholly of the Nazi generation. Artur first joined the NSDAP in secondary school, becoming an exemplary member of the Hitler Youth. After his graduation from the youth ranks of the organization, Artur became Reichsjugendführer, and fully took upon his shoulders the responsibility of teaching the German youth of the greatness of National Socialism and of the German Reich. Notably, he was also responsible for conscripting members of the Hitler Youth into the German army.\n\nAlways a patriot, Axmann also gave service to his country during the Second World War. He fought with the Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front, though was sadly forced to retire from this duty when he lost his arm in combat. Artur has known no life but that of a loyal Nazi since he was a child, and as such, remains totally and absolutely dedicated to the cause he has been brought up upon. As such, he is a clear symbol of the intelligence and dedication of the German children.§!"
 GGR_Ferdinand_Schorner_sec_desc:0 "------------\n§LThey call him "Butcher", "Bloody Ferdinand", "Hound of War" and many other brutal sobriquets. He is content with the title of Generalfeldmarshcall. He is skilled in large scale operations involving hundreds of thousands of men, and he cares nothing for their individual lives. Ferdinand Schörner is a man loved by none and feared by all.

Only time will tell if he has finally met his match, or, as some fear, he is only a step away from achieving his own ambitions.§!"
 GGR_Wilhelm_Stuckart_hog_desc:0 "------------\n§LWilhelm Stuckart was a judge before the rise of the NSDAP, and this brought him under the wing of Hermann Göring, who was Ministerprasident of Prussia at the time. Through his own legal expertise, as well as his growing friendship with the man, Stuckart quickly emerged as Göring's number two man, being partially responsible for much of the Prussian administration during that period, also participating in the theft of numerous cultural artifacts for the administration.\n\nWith the NSDAP's rise to power, Stuckart joined the Ministry of the Interior, eventually becoming a co-author of the Nuremberg Laws. He furthermore was responsible for signing a decree obligating the report of any newborns with deformities. It was later under this very same decree that Stuckart's own one-year-old son was euthanized for being born with Trisomy Twenty-One.\n\nThough he pledges himself to the party and the militarist cause, Stuckart is truthfully only loyal to the advancement of his own career and to his old friend Göring. Much of Stuckart's power has come from pure favoritism, though in these positions, he has proven himself one of the Reich's foremost legal experts. Most importantly however, he is a man whom Göring can trust.§!"
 GGR_Paul_Korner_eco_desc:0 "------------\n§LPaul Körner, while serving as an artillery officer in the First World War, formed a long and lasting friendship with Herman Göring. He would later go on to join the NSDAP and the SS, rising rather quickly as an early member of both. Notably, Körner was present alongside Göring and Hitler during the negotiations for the NSDAP's coalition with Hindenburg, an agreement that led to Hitler's appointment as Chancellor and laid the path for his later rise to rule over Germany.\n\nAfter the NSDAP took full power, Körner found himself appointed as Göring's secretary for the Four-Year Plan, also holding a seat for the NSDAP in the Reichstag. At one time, Körner also served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Reichswerke, a company founded by his old friend. Though Körner is cunning and talented in his own right, his career has undoubtedly been mostly shaped and aided by his friendship with the Reich's uncle, and that does not seem likely to change.§!"
 GENERAL_EDUARD_WAGNER:0 "§LQuartermaster General of the Heer, Eduard Wagner has earned infamy for his brutality towards civilians. A devoted Nazi, Wagner crafted the regulations for the Wehrmacht and SS to cooperate in the killings of Jews and Slavs on the Eastern Front of the Second World War. He managed the task of supplying the Wehrmacht with winter clothes and fuel successfully during said war, and gained respect from many other generals for his efforts. During the West Russian War he reallocated supplies away from Himmler and towards the main front, aiding in holding the line while leaving the SS out to dry when they made their move. Since then Wagner has become ingratiated with the militarists, becoming a close ally of Ferdinand Schörner.§!"

Since then Wagner has become ingratiated with the militarists, becoming a close ally of Ferdinand Schörner.\n\nWagner sided with the militarists in the first German Civil War, and he's sided with the militarists again in the second. Wagner is determined to supply Schörner's forces with all the equipment they can get their hands on, and help Schörner purge degeneracy from the Earth once and for all.§!"
 ADMIRAL_KARL_JESKO_VON_PUTTKAMER:0 "§LKarl-Jesko von Puttkamer is a man of unmatched loyalty and willpower. Always on a fast track to greatness from his noble blood, von Puttkamer has been a man loyal to the Reich and the Reich alone. Hitler's naval adjutant during the war and afterwards, von Puttkamer was very close to the late Führer. Hitler once visited von Puttkamer in the hospital after he was wounded during Himmler's failed coup, proceeding to award von Puttkamer with the Wound Badge. Von Puttkamer currently professes loyalty to only the Führer and the Reich, though he publicly supports Göring and the Militarists.§!"

 GER_GOR_war_plan_c_desc:0 "First we pacified the shattered Reich, then we reestablished our grip upon Europe, recreating the reality of Adolf Hitler's vision. Now we stand victorious once again, having achieved the true dream of Adolf Hitler, without the imperfections of fickle allies to betray us and Russian remnants to harass our armies. Now, after so much war, we are finally coming to the finale of the play: the true Endsieg.\n\nOnly the nuclear powers and those small states that stand between us remain: the SS state of Burgundy, the decadent democracy of America, and the Empire of Japan. They will be stronger foes than any we have faced thus far, but they are still Untermensch regardless of how many nukes and guns they may point at us. We march to the ultimate victory. Sieg Heil!"
 GER_GOR_war_plan_C_new:0 "War Plan C"
 GER_GOR_war_plan_C_new_desc:0 "Heinrich Himmler sought to betray the Reich during the 1950s; now, his rotting pustule of a state shall be burst under the treads of the Heer's tanks. The crumbling Japanese "Empire" betrayed its promises and broke from the Axis; now, they shall be drowned by the might of the Kriegsmarine. The corrupt Judeo-Capitalist Americans humored themselves by calling Germany "the sick man of Europe"; now, they will be reduced to scorch marks by our glorious Luftwaffe.\n\nThe time has come to prepare ourselves. One last time shall we enter the breach to transform the fate of the entire world, and the planet itself will bow to the majesty of the Aryan Race. To arms, men!"

 GER_GOR_wrangling_the_reichstag_desc:0 "The global oil crisis has hit Germany hard. The militaristic faction in our administration, who have exerted their influence on us for so long are currently in total disarray.\n\nMuch of the power they hold has been temporarily stripped thanks to the chaos and upheaval the crisis has caused. The power Schörner and his clique wield at the moment is minimal at best.\n\nThere is no time to waste! Now is the perfect opportunity to put these power hungry bastards in their place! Göring and his allies currently have enough power to remove their rivals from the administration! There is no time to complete this; now is the time for action, and to secure the Reich once and for all for Führer Göring!"
 GER_GOR_the_great_purge_desc:0 "Where there was once a vicious discordance of gunshots and explosions, a dull silence now fills the void. The screams have faded, the dust has settled, and the taste of blood and smoke lingers in the air like a distant memory... but the final body has not yet fallen. Victory everlasting is sweet to the tongue, but there are still toxic elements that threaten to spoil the flavor. Littered throughout the Reich, like an infestation of rats, hide our most craven of foes, those who foolishly believe that the end of the Bürgerkrieg heralds their safety.\n\nThey are wrong. From the liberal scum who blindly followed the lies of Speer to the Bormannite weasels who protected the corrupt status quo, our Great Purge will spare no traitor. With great aid from Reichsmarschall Ferdinand Schörner and the Wehrmacht, Göring's triumph shall be maintained for years to come!"
 GER_GOR_crack_down_on_the_bankers_desc:0 "Banks are inherently untrustworthy organisations - good Christians were forbidden from usury for centuries, relegating the practice to Jews. While we may have eliminated the Semitic menace from our institutions, it seems some of their practices have rubbed off on those who have replaced them. Many of the bankers threw their lots in with Bormann, sealing their fates. Those which did not would do well to keep their heads down while we deal with the traitors among them - and learn well from their mistakes."
 GER_GOR_nationalize_the_banks_desc:0 "The banks have been allowed too much leeway in their dealings. Foreigners, traitors and fools have all received their funding and it is time we end this wastage. Shackling them to the state will ensure their loyalty, and provide a valuable source of cash to fund our plans for the Reich. We don't need to pay them of course - those bankers left are eager for an opportunity to prove their loyalty."
 GER_GOR_a_bayonet_for_the_bankers_desc:0 "Complacency is what got us where we are now. We were complacent with the students, with the bankers, with the rest of our party. No more. We will ensure our grip never slacks on the banks, and keep tabs on whoever is left there. They redoubled their efforts when they never saw their traitorous colleagues again - perhaps this atmosphere can be sustained? They are all guilty of something, and removing one every now and again will do a great deal to remind them where their place is."
 GER_GOR_cage_the_students_desc:0 "Germany's universities have been its pride for many years. Countless Nobel prize winners came from these hallowed halls, and some of the greatest technical minds of this century have been German. Time takes its toll however, and, for the past decade, the Reich's students have been nothing but a thorn in its side. They have turned to discredited ideologies such as democracy and even socialism, and with the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg many Universities rose up as their own statelets. Most, such as Münich and Heidelberg were quickly put down, but those in Albert Speer's territory frequently survived and swore their loyalty to him. While we may have removed Speer from the board, his pawns remain.\n\nThe rubble of the universities is easily picked through. Dig out the students and throw them in a cell. They'll learn the price of their hubris soon enough."
 GER_GOR_round_up_dissidents_desc:0 "There are enemies around every corner, even if there are a few less corners after the war. The Catholic Church has ever been troublesome for us. The Reichskonkordat may have officially stabilised relations with the Vatican, but we stopped paying attention to it long ago. Catholics are everywhere in Bayern and Ostmark, and the priests there too often take it upon themselves to interfere in matters that are none of their business. They learned the value of a good speech long ago, and we must make sure they are unable to give them.\n\nBorders become a lot more porous when all the guns are pointing inwards. Smuggling has taken hold in the East and South, with businesses often turning to their counterparts across the border. We might be able to excuse this if it was a temporary measure but their greedy ways have persisted after the war's conclusion. Punishment is in order. All of these traitors will be confined to prison camps until the Wehrmacht decides whether it is worth killing them."
 GER_GOR_a_bullet_for_the_traitors_desc:0 "The war was long and hard fought, and many still are not willing to accept the proper state of things. Heydrich's SS have been dug out but Bormann and Speer's people remain, ready to resume their sabotage at a moments notice. Anyone willing to serve those who would bring the Reich to ruin is an idiot at best and should be eliminated as a hindrance or a traitor and must be eliminated with prejudice. We shall not make the mistake of letting them live."
 GER_GOR_school_militarization_desc:0 "School is where a mind is honed before it enters service. Children are the future, and Hitler was wise enough to see that. The Hitlerjügend was to be our youth's first taste of a martial life back in the thirties, and we need to inspire a thirst for that now just as much as then.\n\nA gruelling time is ahead of us, and our children need to be prepared for that. A greater focus on physical education will prepare them for the wars ahead. Reichsmarshall Schörner himself has recommended we relax grade requirements - it would be cruel to insult the men who will go on to fight on the front line by giving them failing grades, and there are much better things to educate them on. Every week our youth will perform atomic bombing drills - just in case. Duck and cover, children. "
 GER_GOR_and_chains_for_the_thinkers_desc:0 "We may have dealt with this latest round of rebellious students, but what of the next one? And the one after that? It is our duty to maintain discipline in our children. We shall have Wehrmacht guards stationed at university campuses, officers monitoring the lesson plans, and a few thousand Reichsmarks will buy us a disproportionate number of student informants. What else do students have to complain about but money?"
 GER_GOR_faith_in_the_gun_desc:0 "If things have not calmed down, they have at least stopped heating up. Arms on every street corner do a great deal for one's peace of mind, and have restored faith in the Führer's ability to keep things under control, if not his legitimacy. The rebellious voices have been silenced for now, and if we keep a lid on things they will stay that way. All we have to do is maintain faith in our soldiers, our tanks, and our guns."
 GER_GOR_pride_in_the_fuhrer_desc:0 "Führer Göring has done what seemed impossible, and vanquished all pretenders to his title. That evil administrator Bormann; Speer, the architect of the Reich's destruction; Heydrich, the Man with the Iron Heart who tortured and murdered across Europe. If Hitler's faith in him was not proof of his legitimacy then the destruction of all of his foes certainly is. We should be proud of our Führer, who has fought and commanded across Europe since the First World War, and brought victory in his wake."
 GER_GOR_prepare_the_new_germany_desc:0 "Germany proper has once again been stabilised and the traitors and pretenders destroyed. Now it is time for us to reclaim our rightful Lebensraum as we did two decades ago. Thankfully it will be somewhat easier this time, with no Soviet Union to contest our mastery of Europe. Only our former subjects exist to oppose us - the Americans and Japanese are half a world away. And once we reassert our control, we will be ready for them."
 GER_GOR_prepare_the_army_desc:0 "The Wehrmacht was shattered in the Bürgerkrieg, split into four and set against itself. While we may have gained the greatest share, more than half our officers cannot be trusted, and who knows how many enlisted men. A pruning down is required. Further still, the war proved our tactics outdated and our Heer old fashioned. It must be reformed if we are to reassert control over Europe, so that we may crush our enemies, see them driven before us, and hear the lamentations of their women."
 GER_GOR_a_new_age_of_science2_desc:0 "Never before have our generals had such an influence in policy; they did win us the war, after all. Naturally, they expect their opinions to be heard, and lately they've been clamouring for more funding. A few of the more imaginative of them have been digging up old ideas, ideas discarded as "impractical", and "unfeasible", and "too dangerous to sanction". These ideas may not lead anywhere, but it doesn't do any harm to let them dream. Send some funds down to our research departments to entertain them."
 GER_GOR_war_plan_0_desc:0 "Denmark, Ostland, the Netherlands, Bohemia, Poland and Slovakia. Every journey begins with a first step. And the path to restore the Reich's glory lies in securing its immediate and rightful sphere in Central Europe. These operations have been given the name War Plan 0. Resistance is expected to be futile and miniscule."
 GER_GOR_war_plan_A_desc:0 "Now that the Reich's control over Central Europe has been reestablished, the Wehrmacht is already looking to the Balkans, Scandinavia, the British Isles and the rest of our Reichskommissariat in the East. War Plan A will involve securing control of these vital areas through German steel. This shall not only restore the Reich's pre civil war territory, but also bring order to those nations still defying us in the Baltic and the Balkans."
 GER_GOR_war_plan_b_desc:0 "To have conquered the crumbling states surrounding the Greater German Reich was a matter of inevitability. Now the time has come to immortalise the Fatherland's standing in Europe once and for all and crush the vicious powers that seek to destroy us from without. To the east lie the teeming subhuman masses, huddled within the rotting remains of Russia; with just one final push the Slavic hordes will be crushed under the mighty boot of the advancing Wehrmacht. To the south await the scheming Italians, monkeys in suits who bicker and hoot among themselves while undesirables roam free. Only once the Reich claims victory over Iberia and Turkey can we secure a hold on the Mediterranean, and then nothing will prevent Italy from falling just as Rome had centuries ago."
 GER_GOR_five_year_industrial_plan2_desc:0 "We may talk the talk about the renewed Germany, but it's time to walk the walk. Our factories lie in ruins, our streets are paved with rubble and our fields are filled with the dead. We must rectify this before any attempt is made to restore control outside of the Reich's core.\n\nLearning from one's own mistakes is good but learning from our enemies is better. The Soviets had a good idea or two while they were around, and the Four Year Plan is one the Führer in his economic wisdom has set his sights on. Our industrial planners will draw up estimates - how fast can steel production be brought back to pre-war levels? How quickly can roads between supply centres be repaved, how quickly can chemical production be expanded? A deadline makes everyone work harder. "

Operation von Moltke was a wild success, and the officers of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht are having a well earned celebration. Führer Göring of course must thank his generals for their hard work, and he is never one to miss a party.

Of course, this firepower comes at the cost of the ability to rotate the canons via traditional turret, giving the Liger more in common with a tank destroyer than an MBT in some respects.

 GER_GOR_electronics_research_desc:0 "When we began our domination of Europe all those years ago the development of what we call "electronics" was still very young. There were radios and very primitive TVs of course but nothing like what we have access to now. Even with all of our own achievements however we often find ourselves lagging in this area when compared to the Japanese and Americans. So much of the research into electronics was put into the Space Race during the 50s that we have fallen behind in practical and everyday uses of these systems. The Führer hopes to remedy this and as an opening salvo has ordered a significant budget increase for the GRWI dedicated to R&D of new military and civilian applications of electronics. Germany shall remind the world that it was once a dominant technological powerhouse and with a little greasing of the wheels it will regain its rightful place."

 GER_GOR_atomic_planning_desc:0 "The computer is a machine or device that performs processes, calculations and operations based on instructions provided by a software or hardware program. In the context of atomic development & planning, we have already seen preliminary studies that demonstrate the efficacy of computer-based programmes in testing and refining our projections. GRWI has come to conclude that we must digitalize our efforts if we are to achieve relative success. Thus, we shall design & upgrade nuclear plants with a computer instead of relying on ballpark estimates, thereby improving the construction process. "
 GER_GOR_make_them_grow_like_mushrooms:0 "Make Them Grow Like Mushrooms"
 GER_GOR_make_them_grow_like_mushrooms_desc:0 "The concept of 'Atomic Planning' has largely, up until this point, regrettably found itself constrained by largely environmentalist and conservationist concerns. However, the Führer has chosen to disregard his previous ethos of actually choosing to 'enjoy' or 'protect' the environment, which is useless to waging effective warfare. Instead, with the Führer's blessing, we shall improve the Reich's nuclear programme through the construction of dozens of new plants all across the Fatherland, irrespective of population density or environmental beauty. This will speed up the Großgermanisches Reich's fledgling programme of nuclear development & advancement. It will also bring those who care about the so-called 'environment' and 'health' of the German nation out into the open, where we can trade their placards for long-deserved jail sentences."
 GER_GOR_biology_in_application:0 "Biology in Application"
 GER_GOR_biology_in_application_desc:0 "The field of biology has been progressing ever so rapidly in the two decades since the Second World War. While we may not have always prioritized the biological fields during that time, we were able to learn enough ourselves and steal from our rivals enough to develop increasingly sophisticated pesticides, hormones, and even new synthetic chemicals.\n\nDespite some objections within the GRWI due to the still unclear side effects of many of these substances, the Führer has issued several directives related to their use. The farmers will be given batches of the experimental pesticides and GMOs for practical testing. There are some uncertainties here, but science cannot move forward without the bravery to venture into the unknown."

 GER_GOR_for_the_plants_desc:0 "Out with conservation, in with innovation; it's nothing but scientific progress for the Großgermanisches Reich! So, why should the Reich's produce and plants be exempt from progress? To truly allow the Aryan race to triumph over our inferior contemporaries, we must ensure that every plant in the Reich is stamped with a swastika. Thus, as mentioned, it's best we put 'genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in all of the Reich's plants! We shall eat, and fight, for the future!

Thus, it's best we explore this concept by testing supposed performance enhancing drugs on our already competent soldiers. This will surely make them competent in even greater measure, granting them combat strength and focusing their abilities to superhuman extents. What could possibly go wrong?"

Indeed, the time has come to wonder 'what about the water?' and make it useful in our success as a nation. It is therefore necessary, with the formal recommendation of the GRWI, that the government begins to pump 'Fluorine' (the most electronegative element) into the Reich's water supply. We have undertaken this despite considerable protests from our nation's private sector, who claim it will destroy the toothpaste industry - we have assured Führer Göring that fluorine will deliver improved health and, more importantly, keep the population docile. (And also prevent tooth decay.)"

Once built, the Großgermanisches Reich and its Führer shall control the rays of life itself! We shall be as gods, and nothing will be restrained from us - which we have imagined to do.

We must balance ambition and prudence: how large will the orbital mirror be, and how fine-tuned its albedo, without running the risk of design failure? Yet, without indulging our ambition we shall not achieve godlike status, and so it's best we hurtle like joyful, martial children into the final development of the 'Sun-Gun'. The future awaits! "

Also self-explanatory, we will use the power of the sun itself to annihilate our ideological opponents. The foundational technologies of solar and focused-energy technology are known to us; what is needed is a massive increase in scale. To this end, we shall invest considerable resources into laser and solar technology research & development to ensure the success of the 'Sun-Gun'.

 GER_GOR_Sonnengewehr_directive_desc:0 "How in the hell could this have occurred? We failed, the Großgermanisches Reich was unsuccessful in its attempts to successfully launch & commence formal 'Sun-Gun' operations. A true tragedy for the German nation. Führer Göring is, understandably, deeply dissatisfied with the GRWI lack of foresight with regard to the now-obvious impracticality of the 'Sun-Gun'. He has ordered that all files & departments associated with the failed 'Sun-Gun' be figuratively 'burnt', with all men stationed being 'repositioned' elsewhere within the GRWI to work on less intellectually challenging projects for the Reich. Of course, this was the fault of the GRWI, not of the Führer's leadership - and anyone who dares suggest otherwise WILL BE DEALT WITH SEVERELY."

These previous comrades in arms have been reduced to pathetic lackeys for Himmler, so the time has come to bring an end to this poisonous organization which has done us so much harm. With our forces in a strong position, we will bring the SS to its end in a swift and dramatic manner.

It will flutter as the cherry blossoms do in Tokyo. The people must know of our coming glory and, despite the hardships of the Civil War, the civilians must know of the greatness upon the horizon.

For now, any vestiges of the SS in Germany will be firmly and justly wiped out. We will start by tearing down their bizarre castles that are plastered all across Germany. We might expect there to be some traps or SS officers hiding here and there, but we will go in and come out with as many goods that the SS had been hoarding in their palaces."

With the ashes of the civil war fading, we should give one of our most loyal and faithful generals a triumph of his very own. That man, of course, is Ferdinand Schörner. A loyal soldier and honorable and trustworthy man since the times of World War Two. He truly deserves the triumphs as those Julius Caesar had, and he also has been pushing for this for a long time as he puts it.

 GGR_grenadiers_desc:0 "There is a sentiment among many German generals now that we need some behemoth of an army, but it should be realized that this is just not logistically feasible! The German Military should be what it always has been and what it always should have been: an elite, deadly force of a few honorable, well-equipped divisions, ready to set out and die for their nation. If we bloat our army with borderline undesirables, then we will end up with a disaster on our hands. It has become clear that a Prussian Army cannot be corrupted by weakness, and so only the fittest should be allowed to fight for the valor of the Fatherland. "
 GGR_germanies_finest_desc:0 "There were many among the military during the civil war who's acts of strength were not recognized by us at the time and that is truly a shame. Yes, many Germans did fight valiantly to defeat those who wished to corrode the Reich but many did truly extraordinary things. We need to find such Übermenschen and give them the rewards they deserve, like perhaps promotions, so that our Army will be led by the greatest men Germany has to offer. When we succeed the army will be a true and glorious Prussian army that even the great Fredrick would tremble over! "
 GGR_intensive_training_regimen_desc:0 "Strength and Power are what is in the hearts of every German man; however, some inherently have it more than others. Thus, we need to weed out the weak and elevate the strong. Our training will be harsh, it will be grueling, but it will be necessary. Those who cannot deal with this will be tossed aside, as they shall be a better fit for the factories. However, those who will struggle on will be warriors like those of Sparta, so full of valor and fire that no nation shall dare challenge us ever again. Now is the Era of Strength, and those who do not adapt will be trampled underfoot! "
 GGR_mobile_support_weapons_desc:0 "Tanks and mechanized units have been a great help to us, but we cannot allow these simple tools to get in front of what is truly important. The great infantryman who has shown valor and strength throughout all of the time and to choose these tools of them would make use just as degenerate as the Americans! Mechanized units have proven time and time again to be a strain on our economy and the lack of oil in our homeland means we are dependent on the control of our colonies. Tanks and other mechanized units should primarily act as support to the strength of our infantry, and not overshadow them. "
 GGR_knights_of_the_panzerkorps_desc:0 "The distinguished and renown Panzerkorps must be continuously reviewed and modernized if we are to truly succeed in creating a modern blitzkrieg. We will outfit our Panzerkorps division with the finest warriors in all of the German Reich, to ensure our campaigns against the degenerates of the world are successful. These prestigious knights shall be at the forefront of German propaganda, and shall be given various honors commending their bravery and heroics."
 GGR_armor_every_grenadier_desc:0 "In order to restore the image of a proper grenadier division, we must see to it that our tanks shall be fitted with proper armor from now on.

 GGR_legacy_of_the_ghost_division_desc:0 "First in the line of fire, first into hostile land, the elite Panzer division known as the Ghost Division has gained incredible fame through their oppressive offensive blitzkrieg during the last war. The Ghost Division has proven the strategic ability of tanks on the battlefield, and we must never forget this if we are to create flexible and dependable armored units. Leaders of the Panzerkorps will be given extended logistical support as well as more freedom to move independently on the battlefield. This way, our tanks shall strike at the enemy with a ferocity and surprise never seen before."
 GGR_volksgrenadiers_desc:0 "In the past few years, it has become apparent to German High Command that simply having superior fire power is not enough to overwhelm and annihilate our foes. We must, in addition to having superior tactics, be able to overrun and crush the enemy with our superior numbers. We shall have reserve divisions for every fighting squadron, so that should a German soldier tire or falter, another proud German patriot will take their place on the battlefield."
 GGR_quality_of_quantity_desc:0 "No matter how many guns we make, we will need a man behind every gun to actually fire them. The wars of the past have proven to us that manpower is a far greater tool than that of superior firepower. By utilizing a larger and more organized army, our forces will be able to tactically overwhelm our foe and achieve our goals much easier."
 GGR_gun_in_every_hand_desc:0 "While our conscription efforts for the army have paid off, it seems as if our armaments production has not quite met its increased demand. We must not allow our soldiers to go onto the battlefield unarmed, and as such decisive action must be taken. Engineers and industrialists from all across Germany shall be convened to determine how to deal with this sharp increase in firearm demand."
 GGR_citizenship_through_service_desc:0 "Our war machine is vast, but it needs more fuel! We can have all the oil, guns, tanks, planes, and food in the world, but all of our material is simply of no use if we don't have the men to utilize it. Fortunately for us, there are ways to "encourage" the population to get them to offer their services to the army without implementing conscription.\n\nWe have decided that the only way Germans can obtain full citizenship (which includes state benefits) is for every German citizen to put in their time in the Wehrmacht. Only real Germans, who serve the Fatherland are deserving of becoming full citizens of the Reich!"
 GGR_shock_and_awe_desc:0 "Artillery is the queen of war. She brings great effect to the field, shattering enemy resistance and removing any obstacle that stands in the way of our advance.

Further work on this branch should aid our army."
 GGR_gun_for_every_meter_desc:0 "A wise Japanese officer once made a comment about the Americans. And he stated that "there would be a rifle behind every blade of grass," should they attempt an invasion.\n\nWhile this demonstrated to us that our former allies in the East considered the American threat with due respect, this must mean one thing to us. If we apply that idea to our homeland, it would be possible. But for every meter of our land, there will be more than just rifles; there shall be stores of ammunition and supplies. And our troops will make any enemy pay with their life."
 GGR_grenadier_panzer_operations_desc:0 "The mighty power of the Reich's Panzer divisions have led us to great victories over the years, but these steel behemoths cannot handle all foes by themselves.

These new divisions shall be christened the 'Panzergrenadiers'."
 GGR_restore_the_armies_grandeur_desc:0 "A long time ago, before the unification of the Fatherland, Prussia was called 'an army with a state'. This army soon unified the German Reich and became one of the strongest military forces in the history of the world.\n\nDespite this, the Wehrmacht was never granted the true power it deserved, even in the Reich's glory days. Our troops have defended Germany through the centuries, and they will continue to do so in glory and grandeur for a Thousand Years!"
 GGR_rebuild_the_prussian_staff_college_desc:0 "To serve the Reich as a general of the Wehrmacht is the dream of every brave boy in the nation, but being an officer requires outstanding abilities only a few will ever possess. To help our youth achieve such a dream, we shall restore the old Prussian Staff College to provide aspiring officers with proper education and training. As well as being imbued with the necessary skills, becoming a graduate will provide the youth with great prestige and fame."
 GGR_cuff_titles_and_new_uniforms_desc:0 "The decline of militarism in the Reich has many deep causes, but one important reason is the growing lack of respect towards the officer class. To destroy such rude attitudes, the German people will be reminded of the differences between the average citizen and the brave generals who protect the Reich.\n\nIn the Napoleonic age, generals adorned themselves with gorgeous uniforms which manifested their nobility and dignity; now we shall return to that old tradition by hiring the best designers. Our own Reich has had a fruitful relationship with the Hugo Boss company, and we shall look to them to create our new trappings of rank and office."
 GGR_end_political_interfearance_desc:0 "For too long, the cretinous and selfish bureaucrats of the NSDAP have poisoned the Reich from within; meanwhile, the ingenious officers of the Wehrmacht plan together to save the nation from destruction.

All hail Germany, master of the world!"
 GGR_pride_of_the_reich_desc:0 "While we praise the Heer and the Kriegsmarine for their bravery and loyalty, the German people must be reminded that the Luftwaffe is the pride of the Reich and the trusted guardians of the sky.

The pride of the Reich will continue to lead us into conquests unimaginable!"
 GGR_strike_like_lightning_desc:0 "Fast as the wind and as swift as a soaring eagle, our close air support shall strike at the hearts of our enemies with fear and desperation. Before a counterattack can be arranged, our planes will swoop in and out leaving tremendous damage in their path. Our enemies will never feel a moment of peace, as they will constantly have to worry about an impending aerial assault from our fighter pilots. "
 GGR_higher_faster_better_desc:0 "While our pilots are already considered elite and highly trained, their combat abilities could be further enhanced with better fighters. German engineers must be put to the task of developing faster and more agile fighters in order to better suit our pilots. With the power of German innovation and ingenuity, our enemies will be torn to shreds while we fly higher than we ever have before."
 GGR_destruction_of_nations_desc:0 "Our successful bombing campaigns in Africa and Russia has proved to us one thing: the complete and utter ability for our bombers to rain destruction upon our enemies. They have been left crippled and weak, crawling about like cockroaches too scared to fight. It is pivotal that we continue to develop our bombers in order to ensure our enemies can never fully recover from the destruction left in our wake."
 GGR_barons_children_desc:0 "The Red Baron is considered by many to be the greatest pilot of all time, and as such he has had a tremendous impact on the legacy of the Luftwaffe. Perhaps we could use this influence as a means of recruiting new pilots and help train the next generation of the Luftwaffe. We will implement a program known as "Baron's Children" in order to locate distinguished fighter pilots and allow them to recognize their full potential on the battlefield."
 GGR_fighters_without_equal_desc:0 "Time and time again, the Luftwaffe have proven themselves to be the utmost elite fighting force in the skies. Our fighter pilots outclass even the most veteran of our adversaries, showing the world that our pilots are a force to be reckoned with. The Luftwaffe has created some of the greatest pilots in history, and they should be recognized and commended accordingly."
 GGR_knights_of_the_sky_desc:0 "Even the greatest of pilots can have humble beginnings, and by making this clear to the people we can usher in a new era of elite German aces. The German people will no longer see the path to becoming a pilot as unattainable or impossible, but rather as an honorable and worthy position given out to the best and the brightest Germans who are willing to give their all."
 GGR_fallschrimjaeger_ascendant_desc:0 "The German paratroopers are some of our most highly trained, highly specialized soldiers. They are a credit to their nation, to their race, and to the Führer. Much of their job is, of course, done in the air. That is why they are members of the Luftwaffe, of course. But the paratroopers also maintain the ability to put up a fight on the ground. Not being members of the Heer, these men are furthermore much more willing to do their duty and follow the orders of the Führer above even Schörner.\n\nNaturally, such talented and loyal individuals deserve nothing less than the best from their nation. Göring has arranged for the paratroopers to receive only the best equipment and training, even when such things would not be beneficial to the regular mission of a paratrooper. Despite the blatant favoritism being shown, it is clear to the Führer that this is a necessary measure. If the Heer's loyalty to Göring falls into question, there will be friendly boots on the ground and in the skies of Germania."
 GGR_new_gunships_desc:0 "It has been years since one could field a proper Air Force using only planes, but that is the assumption that the Reich seems to have been making. As technology has adapted and grown, the Luftwaffe has remained rather stagnant in terms of new advances, with the bureaucrats in Germania unwilling to devote the time, funds, and energy to make Germania rule the skies once more.\n\nThis lethargy, of course, has ended as soon as Göring has assumed the title of Führer. With a truly experienced and knowledgeable man in command of the Reich, the German people will begin crafting and implementing helicopters, gunships, and other more effective means of air combat into our engines of warfare. With a fully updated, outfitted, and upgraded Luftwaffe, there is not a chance that the German Reich can lose to the degenerates who would combat our supremacy. Heil Göring!"
 GGR_Assume_spec_ops_burden_desc:0 "Naturally, those Germans who work in Special Operations divisions are the best, most talented soldiers that Germany can field, having a degree of boldness and patriotism that impresses even the Führer. However, these talented individuals have wasted away under the mismanagement of the Heer and Kriegsmarine. Not enough funding is given to them, nor do the military and naval officers seem to understand the burden that Special Operations soldiers carry. Truly, if the Reich's best and brightest are to continue their missions, a change must be made.\n\nOur magnificent Führer, however, has come up with a solution. All existing Spec Ops divisions within the Wehrmacht are to be folded into the administration of the Luftwaffe. After all, it is the Reich's Air Force that truly recognizes skill and dedication required to succeed at such specialized tasks. Additionally, because of Göring's service, he knows the officer core of the Luftwaffe best, and can easily vouch for their competence and incorruptibility. Truly, the Führer has come up with the ideal solution to this problem!"
 GGR_walkurentruppen_desc:0 "The development of the helicopter transport has proven to be immensely beneficial to our troops on the ground, allowing the rapid relocation of both soldiers and supplies. Perhaps we should further pursue developing this technology, in order to create rapid response assault divisions to further mobilize the German war machine."
 GGR_the_parachute_is_obsolete_desc:0 "As of late, it has become increasingly clear to German high command that the implementation of the parachute on the battlefield is dysfunctional and obsolete. Parachute runs have proven to be far more dangerous than they are worth, and we simply cannot risk wasting German lives on the battlefield. Instead, air assault divisions shall be utilized in order to transport our troops on the ground and to provide tactical support to the Wehrmacht."
 GGR_over_any_ground_break_any_foe_desc:0 "From the dense African jungle to the sprawling fields of Russia, our Luftwaffe shall reign supreme. Regardless of terrain, our fighter pilots will maneuver through the skies to annihilate all those who stand in opposition of Germany."
 GGR_reichsalders_desc:0 "Sworn protectors of the sky, our Reichsalders will watch over us with an undying loyalty to the Reich. Our intensive labor towards improving our air force has finally bore fruit, and our grand air force will guide the German people for generations to come. Our foes may try to retaliate and break our spirit, but they will never snuff out the indomitable light of the Luftwaffe!"
 GGR_deutsches_auslandisches_freikorps_desc:0 "While we have seen the passing of many great military minds in Germany, it is time we begin to encourage those in the Reich who wish to further develop our airforce and refine our flight programs.

 GGR_new_silos_desc:0 "While our current nuclear silos are sufficient in keeping up the threat of MAD, they are still too concentrated in certain locations and, thus, we risk being wiped out in a decapitation strike before we can retaliate. Thus, building up new and, more importantly, spread out silo installations in all corners are vital to the defense of the Reich."
 GGR_new_missile_designs_desc:0 "The nuclear arms race means a constant effort to improve, to overcome and to adapt. Obviously our missiles are no exception to this.

The mere thought of a banker and a liberal ruling such a vital part of the Greater Reich... who knows what that Speerite has planned for it?

The fact of the matter is that National Socialism found its first converts amongst the masses thanks to the blunders and scheming of the Judeo-Bolshevik bankers and capitalists. Operating from the shadows, they stabbed the Old Reich in the back, destroyed the Weimar Republic's economy and tried to bring down the entire world through the Wall Street Crash.

Some have questioned the necessity of allocating naval resources to Operation Ostwind, given that we face no threats within the Baltic from either the SS or Burgundy.

The Wehrmacht is insistent that none of the officials in Ostland are above suspicion and demands the right to subject them to military justice.

Due to the failures of his army, the butcher Kovner roamed unchecked slaughtering the Germans of the eastern with impunity, and treacherous SS lunatics and traitorous liberals have controlled large stretches of Ostland. Whilst we will intervene on his behalf, and bring him to the Pakt, we must do so with caution, for there is no room for weakness in the new Reich especially when that weakness is so close to the heartland."

Though many of the militarists, notably Schörner, have complained about what they see as the politicians taking their glory, it is widely agreed upon that no Germans should die over such a rock as Norway.\n\nWe can only wait and hope they accept.

Unfortunately, the bases have slowly wasted away, due to the relatively tight budget of the Kriegsmarine in the last 20 years and the loss of control at the start of our Civil War.\n\nTo fix this, we will send thousands of slaves and materials to fix these bases, turning them into the great harbors and naval bases to rival those in Iceland.

By using our fleet to cut off major ports and blockade the coastline, we will shatter the Norwegian economy, causing economic collapse and driving the Norwegians to poverty and starvation. If the plan succeeds, the Norwegians will be too weak to lift a finger against our forces when we land.\n\nUnfortunately, this plan does have some flaws. The Kriegsmarine is underfunded and still somewhat damaged from the chaos of the civil war, and currently is not in the best shape to conduct any large scale operations such as a blockade of the long Norwegian coastline. In addition, the fortifications we built with German sweat to hold off any western invasions, complete with naval guns, are undoubtedly now in the hands of the traitorous Norwegians, and may be used against our fleet.\n\nBoth of these problems are easily fixable, of course. Pumping money into programs is one of Göring's strengths, and the sheer might of our cannons and weapons will undoubtedly be enough to obliterate whatever puny resistance the Norwegians may put up.

Not only that, but helicopters can also be used as a form of close air support, supporting troops and providing quick fire on any enemies on the ground. By using this fascinating new technology, we can swarm the resisting Norwegians with a cloud of steel and lead, overwhelming their defenses and seizing ports before they can mount a defense.\n\nOf course, helicopters have their drawbacks. Their slow speed makes them susceptible to anti-aircraft attacks, and their air-to-air capabilities are limited at best. However, with the numbers we will bring, this will not matter.

To combat this, we shall use an invention that the strategists of 1940 could only dream of- missiles. By building up bases in Denmark, we will be able to fire missiles of all kinds into the mountains of Norway, obliterating any bunkers and forts in a hail of rockets and bombs, without a single German man being forced to lay his life on the line.\n\nIn addition to the immediate strategic benefit of these bases, they will also be a fine addition to our defenses against any American incursion into Europe, covering the entrance into the Baltic and much of the North Sea. Indeed, some have even gotten to asking why these positions have not been built before now. While the answer to this mainly lies in the economic downturn of the 50's, this issue matters little to the current situation.

Of course, these two points are now being hammered furiously by a seething Schörner and his acolytes.

After all, time is of the essence now, as every day our food supply gets more and more strained. With the total failure of the first plan, it seems that Göring will be forced to cave to Schörner's request- a great victory for Schörner, and perhaps a way to win for the Reich, but a true humiliation for Göring and those who stand against Schörner and his group.

Natives refuse to follow orders, insolent citizens lie to our soldiers regularly, and decrees from the Reichskommissar go unheeded. This cannot stand, but the standard strategy of brutally cracking down is so clearly a mistake in this situation that even Schörner is against it.\n\nInstead, as much as it pains us to stoop so low, we must win back the people of Ukraine through a hearts and minds campaign.

Of course, such a success requires parades and celebrations all across Germany, of which both have been celebrated. Perhaps the happiest men in Germany, though, are the Führer and Schörner, who both celebrate for different reasons.\n\nSchörner celebrates because the Wehrmacht once again has a great success under its belt, and every day its standing with the people grows.\n\nGöring celebrates because, once again, the wealth of Ukraine is in his hands, and the people's adoration returns to him almost as quickly as it rains down upon the soldiers who fought for the fields of Ukraine.\n\nThe victory in Ukraine is surely one to remember, and one can only hope that such success continues to follow the Wehrmacht in its next exploits."

Though trigging direct conflict with him will be unwise, war has brought us several chances to limit his power. Since his influence has reached too high at present, the invasion of Iberia will be an optimal chance for actions.\n\nAccording to our military plan, many of our officers including Schörner's loyalists will be transported by ships. By proper arrangement, we can make some ship be filled with Schörner's men and then just disappear on sea. Sea monsters, Iberian infiltrations, American spies...people may blame this accident on different names, and a horrific legend will be a perfect story for us."

There is a widely whispered explanation of his paranoia that he just wants to get rid of those whose loyalty toward him are suspected. Though such a story sounds hard to confirm, the Führer himself still appreciate Schörner's genius in the story regardless of their personal relationship.\n\nAnd now, during the invasion of Iberia, reports about the fortifications in the hills caught the Führer's attention. Those forts are surely hard to attack and occupy, so why don't we make Schörner's loyalists deal with them? No matter what their plan is, our orders will be simple and clear: keep charging until those forts are occupied or destroyed. And the greatest part of this plan is, Schörner will have no reasons to reject our orders. Thinking of that point, a little smile creeps across the Führer's mouth."

Franco and Salazar were wise to create a united Iberia to avoid such endless conflicts, but without proper guidance, chaos quickly stroke back and consumed these two caudillos' success. And only thanks to the Reich's quick move, order has been restored on the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nAs a result of such a history, the Reich has made the decision that the Iberian Union will be restored by us. Being the protector of Europe, we'll take the responsibility to maintain peace and order in Iberia. Guarded by the Wehrmacht, this time the Union will last as long as the Reich itself."

Though their activity has dropped a lot after the Divorce, they could still be a serious problem for our rule in Iberia if we don't find a proper way to deal with them.\n\nThough many has suggested that those partisans are dangerous to our rule and need to be eliminated, the Führer believes such ideas are too unrealistic and naïve, since even local governments cannot achieve that. Instead, he believes that we can use some partisan organizations who aren't hostile to the Reich to fight more dangerous enemies and keep peace across the peninsula. It's obvious that his genius will grant us stability of Iberia."

If you find each other hard to get along with, then fine, you don't need to see or hear them now, for the Reich will cut all connections between you and your former partner.

Therefore, the Wehrmacht and the German people respect the Basques for their unyielding spirits, and are willing to help them achieve their dreams.\n\nWhile an independent Basque nation may be too unrealistic now, we can liberate them from the Spanish and grant them some kind of autonomy, in exchange of their help in our local policing and war efforts. In addition, we will absorb more Basques into our battle units and describe our treatment of them as a proof of the Reich's benevolence.

Their industries and resources will be nationalized by Germany, and every move they take will be closely watched. If they dare to do anything without the permission from us, they're going to face some serious consequences.

We will never keep a close eye due to the long distance, but on the contrary, even more efforts will be taken to make our control of the peninsula can be controlled as solid as other parts in Europe.

Meanwhile, with the fall of the Iberian nations, the desert of Morocco is now a land without owner, and all we need to do is to take whatever still lies there.\n\nIn addition, the fall of Gibraltar also means the lifeline of Mediterranean nations is now in the grasp of us. The block of dam will greatly weaken our potential enemies in that area such as Turkey and Italy and make our conquest of Europe much easier. Once upon a time, the great power who controls the whole Mediterranean was seen the greatest empire in the world. And from today, the golden road of glory and greatness has lied before us."

At this moment, the peninsula is consumed in the flame of bloody conflicts, with different factions fighting endlessly with each other, hoping to find their own place in this chaotic abyss.\n\nBut only we know that, soon this brutal drama will meet its end, as the Reich's iron fist has prepared to smash on the peninsula.

Such courage, resolve and unyielding will is just the proof of their noble origins, and are always respected by the German people.\n\nHowever, even the most noble child could still fall into a wrong and dark path without rightful guidance. Trapped in the Iberian quagmire, the Basque people have forgotten their blood and degenerate into barbarism and ignorance. Luckily, as the natural leader of all Aryan people in this world, the Reich has more than enough patience toward its little brothers.

Consequently, it will be a necessity to set up local headquarter for the Wehrmacht if we wish to push further into the hearts of the Iberian nations. And with the conquest of Basque people's homeland, we've found the ideal position for this headquarter.\n\nLocated on the north part of Iberia, the Reichskommissariat Baskenland will be tasked to maintain local order, collect industries, and most importantly, serve as the command center of our forces on the Iberian battlefield. Each unit is an organ, and the HQ will be the brain to coordinate their moves and make actions as quickly as possible."

And the good news is, we've decided to give them a hand.\n\nBy giving them a little financial and material assistance, they will be asked to cooperate with us in administration and policing.

And now, as the Reich is looking for collaborators in the Iberian campaign, a helping hand from them is worthy of consideration.\n\nFor now, the Führer has authorized the shipment of guns and ammunitions to the fighters in the Frente Azul.

Catalonia is at the borders of our sphere, and it will be a breaking point of our military campaigns in the peninsula. Meanwhile, the destruction of Catalonian rebels will be a great strike for those who hope to see the end of our new order, especially those cunning leftists.

To ensure our rule over Spain, a huge construction program must be made to improve the infrastructure levels to a standard that can at least be tolerated in our eyes.

Action must be taken immediately if we wish to have a stable Iberia at our back.\n\nThat action, as our trusted generals have seen, is not difficulty to find. In the past, the Iberian Union had the Axencia Anti-Separatista to fight against the terrorists, and we will create a similar department called "Agentur zur Seperatistenbekämpfung", or ASB in short. Some may say learning from the AAS will be a mistake, for they had totally failed their duties in past, but how the hell could the German agents act as poorly as those Latin trash? A peaceful and stable Iberia will be created by the ASB swiftly and effectively."

They may not be the best friends we can make, and it is understandable such some may think the places we choose to make friends are too weird, but no one can deny that they will be useful friends to us.

But despite of how strong the fort Spanish and Portuguese have built is, they're naïve to believe that it can resist the power of the German Reich.

Attempting amphibious assaults across the coast of Iberia is possible but significantly more risky than storming across the Pyrenees.\n\nThe French are of course far too weak to oppose us, even if they are independent now. All we would have to do is threaten an invasion and they will no doubt fold. They won't risk another invasion after their recent losses to Burgundy and Brittany.

To prevent the unnecessary loss of the Heer, special forces will be tasked with the vital part of this campaign.\n\nWhen the war breaks out, our specials forces will immediately set out and breakthrough the enemy's front. Our paratroops will land from the air like eagles, our marines will appear from the sea like sharks, and our mountain infantries will sneak in and destroy their forts in hill like ghosts.

Convinced by their points, the Führer has grant the Abwehr full authority over our negotiation with those organizations. After all, some disorderly terrorists are much easier to deal with than Iberian regular army, and they are a far more distant threat to consider.

However, the Führer has much cooler head than those officials, and he has made a more cautious decision.\n\nAccording to the Führer's command, we need to keep our funds to those terrorists at the minimum level instead of meet their needs. Every one need to learn that the Reich isn't their babysitter and they don't have rights to make demands on us. And more importantly, we only need them to distract the Iberian forces, and when the conquest of Iberia finish, they will be much easier for us to deal with if they have only received little help from us.

We could use them to subvert the local government of the Iberian Union, and by doing this, we shall be able to weaken the resistance we're going to face when the war breaks out.

And since they're definitely not racial brothers of the Reich, there is no reason that they could enjoy any privilege that other Iberian people shouldn't have.

Eventually, the prosperity and stability of the Iberian Union was doomed in constant violence and riots.\n\nBut now, we could tell those terrorists that, their good old days are gone.

Divide, conquer and rule over, such a strategy is as old as time itself, and we shall implement it here.\n\nIn addition, to avoid the possible risk of communication and cooperation between different ethnic groups in Iberia, we need to divide those people with enough caution.

And thus, our soldiers must stay vigilant enough at any time.\n\nFor the US, Iberian Peninsula is westernmost part of Europe and therefore has great strategic values. Our agents reported that secret ships and OFN spies have been sent from their ports to Iberia. Due its distance between Germania and Iberia, we may not be able to deal with the sudden case there and as the result, we can only rely on the sense of responsibility of our local occupied forces.

And now, as the whole Iberian Peninsula has been firmly controlled by the Reich, we are able to cut the throat of the Italians and destroy their ability to sustain themselves.\n\nToday, according to the direct order from Germania, the Gibraltar Dam will be closed until all Mediterranean nations bow before the German Reich. When we started constructing the dam, many have doubted and even mocked at the utility of such a grand project, especially when the program was suspended due to financial reasons. But now, the dam will become a true nightmare for all Italians when they realize how terrible their shortages can be. After closing the Gibraltar dam, all our plans about Iberian Peninsula will be finished perfectly, as the economy of Italians will soon be strangled to its last breath.

It will be a tough battle, as the wretches not only had the time to prepare for war while we were crushing their brothers, but they also enjoy the protection of the Urals themselves: tall, impervious and heavily fortified, these mountains will prove a difficult challenge even for our best units.\n\nThe Oberkommando has devised two possible solutions to this problem. The first is to send in more fresh troops from the Vaterland to storm the mountain fortresses, a costly but effective solution. The second is to establish Russian penal battalions and force them to attack the fortifications or face execution: while much cheaper in both money and German lives wasted, this solution is also riskier as there is a higher chance of desertion or even revolt..."

As the last wars taught us, there's always too much Russian blood left to spill: there must be, if they can repopulate so quickly after suffering such losses twice in two decades...\n\nIn order to take the mountain forts, we shall form Russian penal battalions by conscripting wretches taken from prisons and slave camps. They'll have a simple choice: almost certain death at the hands of their own kin up in the snowy Urals, or certain death at our hands if they refuse. If they survive, there's always another fort to take, or another minefield we can't spare deminers for...\n\nAfter all, we are just copying their own tactics: as Zhukov said, "If there is a minefield, the infantry will advance as if there wasn't a minefield"
 GGR_redevelop_the_roads_desc:0 "Advancing towards Siberia is a difficult task for our logistical department. Russian infrastructure is already underdeveloped enough, but the situation has worsened after the bombing campaign and the fighting: now, most railroads are fully unusable, and the majority of the roads are covered in craters, almost all bridges cut to prevent us from advancing.\n\nIf we want to ensure our troops receive all the supplies they need for the coming campaign, then a concerted effort is needed to bring the infrastructure back to working order.

The inferiors should find comfort in the fact that their sacrifice will serve to elevate the Reich to even higher reaches of power and might!"
 GGR_rebuild_the_aa_line_desc:0 "The Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan Line was the original target of Unternehmen Barbarossa. A line cutting Russia from North to South along the Volga river, it was to be extensively fortified and serve as a buffer against any attempt at either invading or bombing Germany from the East. However, due to the economy collapse in the Fifties, it was left almost undefended and subsequently lost to the Second Russian War. Even though we managed to repel the offensive, the border was redrawn nearer to Moskowien.\n\nWith our offensive triumphant, we can now reverse this shame! The A-A Line shall be rebuilt, a stalwart sentinel forever guarding Germania from her enemies! The first step is to rebuild the forts and trenches, a sufficient measure for now as the Russians don't possess the means to properly threaten complex fortification systems. In due time, we shall complete the work, and the line will stand for a thousand years!"
 GGR_eyes_to_the_steppes_desc:0 "The steppes of Central Asia are a potential source of problems. With their bandits and revanchist warlords, any Reichskommissariat we establish in Russia will suffer incursions and raids: the best solution is, of course, crushing these degenerates before they can pose any actual threat!\n\nBy relenting our offensive against Eastern Russia, and concentrating our efforts on the Central Asian warlords, we'll be able to resume our offensive without any hindrance coming from our exposed flank."
 GGR_man_vs_machine_desc:0 "Most of the steppe bandits rely on hit-and-run tactics, where cavalry forces, supported by few motorized units, strike at the enemy from the flanks or the rear, steal any useful loot, and then retreat before the foe can retaliate. This will prove to be a hindrance, and requires an adequate response.\n\nBy bolstering our mechanized corps, even our basic infantry will be far superior to anything they can throw at us! The nomads of the steppes have no mechanized forces, and even should they have any, they'll probably be a small percentage of their total army, which means they'll be mercilessly crushed by our technologically and numerically superior regiments!"
 GGR_torch_it_all_desc:0 "Central Asia is mostly worthless in the larger picture. Bereft of any meaningful industrial base or even resource wealth, it would be useless to waste men and reichsmarks to establish a proper garrison and administration.\n\nHowever, what we can do is to strip this useless land of anything worth reusing and relocating the machinery near Moskowien, where we'll be able to properly exploit it without the need for constant watch..."
 GGR_dont_look_back_desc:0 "With our duty done here, we can leave Central Asia without looking back. When the rest of Russia is properly dealt with, we'll return and establish a proper Reichskommissariat, but for now this land is best left on its own.\n\nIf we're lucky, the wretches will even kill each other on their own without any outside help! This would considerably speed up our plans to integrate the region..."
 GGR_finish_them_off_desc:0 "With most of Russia under our control, we can now launch the final offensive against the Siberian warlords!

It is time to humble our greatest rivals.\n\nThe first of these are our ethic brothers, the fanatical SS holdout in Burgundy. Their only saving grace is that they have a stockpile of nuclear munitions that they aren't afraid to launch. Cracking the 'Ordensstaat' will be challenging, but well worth the effort. Next on our list is the Empire of the Rising Sun; the cursed and traitorous Japanese. Although their army and navy is large and strong, they are spread thin trying to maintain their stranglehold in Asia; something we may be able to exploit. Last but not least....\n\nAmerica. Land of the Free, and Home of the Brave, or so they tell themselves. In reality, their only saving grace is the two oceans that have protected them from our might for over two decades! With our capabilities now, however, focing the Americans to truely bend the knee to us is a not just a pipedream, but a totally feasible task.\n\nThe battles ahead will be fierce and deadly. Yet, we have full faith in our warriors. One last effort, and the Reich will be left standing as the sole superpower on the planet!

The Empire of the Rising Sun has fallen far since their last great victories, which gives us the opportunity to strike deep into their economic heartland; continental Asia.\n\nOur greatest challenge is establishing a land border with Japan's Sphere. We have two equally ambitious routes.\n\nThe first proposed plan is to kick down the rotten door to our east one last time and finally conquer the Rus. The terrain Siberia is inhospitable and we would need to build supporting infrastructure, but is the most direct route to Japan's holdings.\n\nAlternatively, we could surprise the world and make our approach south, through Iran and India. Though the going will be tough, to say the least, it would be completely unpredictable. Our aggression would likely catch Japan off balance, which could be decisive in the coming war.\n\nIn either scenario, we will also focus on making contact with unwilling participants in Japan's Sphere. By offering the nations chained to Japan freedom, we could gain some much needed friends and footholds in the east.

When the time finally comes, our army, in one fell swoop shall strike out and sweep aside all who oppose us!\n\nWe will only have one shot at this. Once the attack begins, we will commit everything towards overrunning the south and establishing our border with Japan as soon as possible in the local area.

With plenty of saturation bombing, we should be able to sweep away any resistance that would dare stand before us and blitz through the country in no time. That takes us to the gates of India, the largest challenge presented to us.\n\nHere, our panzers and mobile infantry will shine as we break out of the mountains and into the sub-continent itself.

GGR_review_the_fleet_desc:0 "Once upon a time, before Hitler had even joined the National Socialist movement, the Kaiserliche Marine was the pride of Germany, and the envy of the world. Indeed, it was so powerful that the weak, pitiful west forced us to dismantle it after the shame of the Great War, for fear of us returning to greatness. Of course, this did not stop us from rebuilding our fleet in the glory days of the Reich, restoring the Kriegsmarine to heights unseen by even the Empire. By the end of the Second World War, the German fleet was among the strongest on earth, with the masses of U-Boat wolfpacks becoming the bane of our enemies and the surface fleet, backed by the power of our battleships, spreading fear across those who opposed us. For a time, it seemed, the old imperial dream of naval dominance could be achieved.\n\nHowever, as of late, the Kriegsmarine has been, if not treading water, sliding backwards in its ability. The ships and submarines rust in their harbors, underfunded and undercrewed. The Kriegsmarine in general has become the black sheep of the Heer, constantly overlooked in favor of the Luftwaffe and the Wehrmacht's needs. Nowadays, the Kriegsmarine is in a state of disrepair, slowly decaying. This cannot stand, especially with some of the Führer's more grandiose plans requiring a strong navy to succeed.\n\nTwo schools of thought have emerged in the Admiralty, each butting against each other in a constant battle. The first school emphasizes the need for battleships in the modern age, arguing that with simple renovations and fixes, the sheer power a battleship brings would dominate both the American and Japanese fleets. The second school pushes heavily to scrap our old battleships, instead pivoting into the new world of carrier-based doctrine.\n\nThe decision falls to Göring now, who must decide- shall the old, tried and tested battleship prevail, or will it fall to the modern competition of the aircraft carrier?"

GGR_gut_the_hulks:0 "Gut the Hulks"

While this choice is certainly a controversial one among the old guard of the Kriegsmarine, it is certainly a necessary one- what use is a battleship if it can't even see its target?\n\nThe restructuring of the Kriegsmarine is set to begin immediately, starting with the renovation of the battleships. The process to gut the old kings of the sea, painful as it is, must be begun now. That way, with both the weight of maintenance and the profits of the scrap, we can begin production on our new line of carriers, and make a tidy profit in the end. Though this process will strike deep at the heart of any true German patriot, it must be begun now, or else we will find ourselves unready and unable to fight when the time comes."

GGR_mass_conversion_to_aircraft_carriers_desc:0 "Though many of our old battleships are being scrapped, an interesting movement has arisen from the Admiralty, culminating in the submission of a new plan to the Führer. While this plan does not try to save the battleships in their current forms, what it proposes is almost as shocking and daring as the original change.\n\nThe plan, obviously refined and rewritten multiple times, details the potential opportunity we currently have to refit our battleships into carriers, instead of scrapping the old hulks and building new ships. While the process of converting our battleships into carriers is certainly a costly one, the plan emphasizes both the practical and overall benefits of such a change. Practically, the plan will allow us to keep some of the old hulls around as bases to new carriers, instead of being forced to fully scrap each of our relics. Overall, these retrofits would give us the necessary experience needed to build full carriers.\n\nWhile scrapping the battleships is certainly the more economical choice, the possibility of repurposing our old prides of the fleet into a modern day wonder of Germany has captivated the Führer. With the flick of his pen and a word to his advisors, the plan has changed, and those battleships that once seemed to be reaching the end of the line have been granted a new lease on life."

In such a situation, it seems the risk is just too great.\n\nTherefore, as painful as it is, we will have to dismantle and scrap some of the Kriegsmarine's greatest ships. Though we have tried to save and restore them, it seems that the years of neglect and disrepair have taken their toll. Even now, scrapping ships take the first sections of these kings of the sea apart, tearing old traditions away piece by piece.\n\nEvery cloud has a silver lining, however, and the silver lining in this particular cloud is quite comforting. The steel we scrap from the oldest battleships can be remade into the hulls and sections of our new carriers. In effect, the legacy and history of the battleships of old will live on in a new, modern form. Isn't that a sweet thought?"

Whatever one's opinion is on the plan in the Kriegsmarine, the only important opinion on the matter is the Führer's, and he is firmly in favor.\n\nAs Göring bluntly states, the only way to defeat such superpowers as America and Japan is to defeat their navies on the open seas, and a modern Plan Z would give the Kriegsmarine the ability to do just that. As Hitler worked so tirelessly to defeat the Royal Navy, so shall we work tirelessly to defeat the Americans and Japanese.

The Kriegsmarine, instead of throwing money into the pit of a full fleet retrofit, shall stay the course of the Fleet in Being. Instead, our fleet shall renovate our battleships into the modern age, adding the improvements of the modern age to our behemoths.

If no solution is found, then we will be sending rookies into battle against our enemies, who have great experience in the art of naval warfare. Such a situation would be asking for disaster.\n\nLuckily, the solution is right in front of our eyes.

The Führer leant over the canvas, his prodigious bulk blocking out the overhead light like an eclipse over the Western Hemisphere. His finger gestured between two of the largest blocks on the map before he leaned back again with a wobble, satisfied, and took yet another sip from his glass.\n\n"This is where we will find our allies."\n\nThe figure to his right stared down the bridge of his nose through his reading glasses doing his best to ignore the winestain that formed a new landmass in the Atlantic. "Haiti and Cuba?". Schörner's lip curled upwards into a sneer. "Forgive me, mein Führer, but while they would provide excellent staging posts for further operations their cooperation is unnecessary - and I expect not forthcoming. To notify them of our intentions would be counterproductive in excess."\n\n"Have a little faith, Ferdinand. I am told the Haitian regime has taken great inspiration from National Socialism - no doubt they will be overjoyed for assistance against America and Dominica."\n\nSchörner resisted the urge to remind Göring that Dominica was a completely different place to the Dominican Republic - with the amount of wine the Führer has consumed it was unlikely he would understand. "And Castro? The man is an ardent Communist. If he chose to work with us he would either be a fool or a backstabber."\n\nGöring seemed to be deliberately ignoring him, and had already begun writing a letter with a wobbling hand. "You have no head for diplomacy, Ferdinand. Certainly we could invade all of the Caribbean, but a little goodwill goes a long way."\n\nSchörner simmered on the inside. On some days, he was sure the Führer only played these little games to spite him and the other militarists, a way of feeling in control once again, but on other days the almost insanity of the man seemed genuine. So be it he thought, let the Führer dream of being a diplomat. He would begin drawing up the backup plans."

Whilst Cuba is strong and proud, in the event of conflict between the Reich and the USA it risks being trampled between them. Only the Reich can offer protection in these circumstances, for it is the might of the Reich that will eventually prevail. To this end, it is my decision to offer you the honour of membership in the Einheitspakt, and all the benefits associated with it. Cuba's independence will be guaranteed under the auspices of the Reich.\n\nWhile I understand there is a well worn enmity between proponents of our two respective ideologies, you can surely appreciate that these troubled times are hardly fit for zealots of any belief system.

In came a group of four men who looked far more suited in overalls and straw hats than the suits they were wearing. As soon as they laid eyes on Göring, they made the faces of children in a candy shop or of men facing their reckoning with God. Hell, they were probably resisting the temptation to kneel on the floor and grovel. Their leader, Robert Williams, said nervously, "Mein Führer, it is the greatest honour of our lives to meet you."\n Göring nonchalantly flicked the cigarette ashes on his desk. He was not paying these strange men much attention. "Oh? Oh, yes, of course. It's my pleasure." The two military men beside Göring give him a look that was more exasperated than angry, as they were used to and perfectly happy with their supposed leader's apathy and numbness by this point.\nRemer got straight to business. "Gentlemen, you have certain paramilitary organizations who might be willing to support our cause against your degenerate government, correct?"\n "Yessir!" Replied the second-in-command Gordon Mohr. "The Christian Patriots Defense League is at your disposal."\n "Sure... Excellent. Let us discuss some plans we have for the assassination of the US president," said Remer, who was effectively controlling the meeting by now. These were some of the most eccentric men any of the three Germans had ever seen, but there was no harm in getting them to do some dirty work for the Reich if they were so eager to help.\n At the end of the meeting, Mohr humbly asked, "Mein Führer, if I may make one small request of you. I have a letter from one of our fellow sympathizers, Father Charles Coughlin that he has asked I give to you to read. It would be another wonderful honour."\n "Of course," replied a distant Göring, almost forgetting to reach out and take the letter. "I will gladly read it.""

A few of them did manage to get inside and shoot some random congressmen, guards, and bureaucrats, but the president was safely evacuated from Washington D.C. the moment the attack began.\nThere is no easy end to this war like we had hoped, but we at least managed to wreak some havoc upon the American government."

After a tortuously long week that had been dominated solely by political matters related to the newest of the Reich's occupational regimes, Göring had managed to get one blessed night to himself. How to spend it had never been in question; the Staatsoper Germania had premiered a new run of Weber's Der Freischutz, and the Führer was determined to attend the show come Hell or high water. Why, even if Schörner were to barge in and announce that they had entered into war with America or Japan, Göring would not be dissuaded. He needed this as a man in a desert needs water.\n\nBundled up in multiple layers for disguise and accompanied only by the most discrete and trusted of his personal guard, the man who ruled over all of Europe and much of Asia and Africa did not look the part. He was careful to avoid the gazes of any of the other opera goers, as even with all of his efforts to disguise he was still the most known man in the Reich, if not the world. After a few stressful encounters necessary to procure his seat, Göring was finally able to take a place in the most prestigious of the viewing boxes. Now all that was left was to relax, and immerse himself in the show.\n\nThat was his plan at any rate, but it was not destined to be. The performance, as expected of the renowned theater, was as terrific as Göring could ever remember it being; its quality was not what haunted his mind as the lines of "O diese Sonne" ran through his head. No, it was the dawning realization on the part of the Führer that he, for all his power and prestige, was in no better a situation than young Max. Those damned militarists, Schörner, Remer, and the rest, they were the demonic Zamiel who had given him the magic bullets that had granted him such success. When, the thought flashed into his mind, would it come time for the seventh bullet to be fired? And what would be its terrible price? He shuddered silently as unbidden images of hellfire and death presented themselves to him in an inescapable montage of doom. The magic of the night was gone, and the Führer collapsed into a deep sense of fear as he heard the chorus utter the line that had always been able to move him before, only now in quite a different sense."

There were always Aryan heroes who rose to defend Europe from these mongrels of Islam - men such as Vlad the Impaler and John Hunyadi - but still the Turks endured, never loosening their clammy grip on the south-eastern Balkans.

We know that no matter what we do, crossing the Caucasus will be a bloody affair; maybe we should just bite the bullet and accept our casualty estimates as they are. When confronted with the possible damage to morale the troops might suffer, the same generals who suggested this strategy noted our massive reserves of Pervitin, a combat stimulant left over from the last war.

GGR_our_foothold_in_asia_desc:0 "With the land secured and the most rebellious occupants dealt with, we can formally welcome Reichskommissariat Kleinasien to the Greater German Reich! This land of coastlines and mountains will be the springboard for projecting German power into the entirety of West Asia, thanks to our infrastructural improvements and the vast amount of natural resources it provides. The barbarians who infest Kleinasien continue to be a minor problem, but their time will come soon enough. We now possess one of the most defensible geopolitical regions in the world, and the Turkish threat to the Balkans has been ended forevermore. Regardless of what the future might hold for the Reich, we have achieved a great victory for civilization."

 GGR_the_hawk_and_the_hunter_desc:0 "The Führer knew this day would come. Schörner was always a perfidious snake, waiting for the perfect moment to strike and claim power for himself. Now, with the Reich stronger than ever and the Wehrmacht pushed to its very limits, he plots against his commander-in-chief and thereby the entirety of the German people. Should he succeed in overthrowing our government, the Reich will surely be plunged into an abyss from which it will never escape - a deathtrap of deranged militarism and senseless violence.\n\nGöring must rise to the challenge one last time. For the Reich and its glorious conquests to be secured in perpetuity, the Monster in Uniform must be destroyed along with each and every deviant traitor who would follow him."
 GGR_donitz_shadow_desc:0 "The Kriegsmarine, even after being brought to heel, was never a friend to Göring. Grand Admiral Dönitz's shadow still hangs over our great fleet, tainting it with Bormannite conservatism. While the Führer now finds himself facing his own erstwhile militarist allies, there are still far too many questions about the political nature of the Kriegsmarine's leadership. It is unlikely that Schörner has brought any of them into his camp, but if their loyalty is not secured they might choose to remain neutral in the power struggle, just as they did during the Bürgerkrieg. Still, if the Führer can demonstrate the validity of his new, dynamic form of National Socialist conservatism, they might be reined in and their mighty guns directed to his benefit."
 GGR_can_we_trust_the_kriegsmarine_desc:0 "The Führer must have his navy on-side to maintain German power projection and overseas capabilities, no matter what comes. Quiet negotiations shall begin; the Abwehr will be dispatched to probe the officer corps for any Schörnerite presence or plans of disloyal neutrality. Their loyalty is easily worth whatever paltry concessions they might demand of the Führer in exchange for deeper political cooperation. Once their political position is ascertained, our strategy for handling them can be adjusted accordingly. They certainly can't be any harder to manage than the militarists ever were."
 GGR_find_the_trustworthy_desc:0 "The struggle between the Führer and his treasonous field marshal is not yet common knowledge outside the shadowed halls of the Reich Chancellery. The average German on the street knows nothing of the coming storm, and the Kriegsmarine, always at sea, knows even less. Of course, this is precisely how the Führer would have it; the fewer individuals are compromised with knowledge of the divide in the Reich's leadership, the better. Care must be taken in our present dealings with the Kriegsmarine so that they learn nothing more than they must. Only those few reliable admirals with a vested interest in Göring's success should be brought on board."
 GGR_we_know_who_we_can_trust_desc:0 "Namely, not the Kriegsmarine. During the Bürgerkrieg, they fled to Crimea, showing that the only colors they flew were their own. They might have professed loyalty to the Reich above all else, but how could we ever believe that excuse when Göring was clearly the only legitimate Führer in the first place? The Kriegsmarine has been insubordinate for years, dithering at every order and not even bothering to maintain the correct political standards for its leadership. The only appropriate solution is to cut out this cancer infecting the Reich - purge the ranks, from the admiralty down to the lowliest e-boat crew! They will be of little use against Schörner anyway, so who will miss those sea-rats?"
 GGR_an_airforce_with_a_navy_desc:0 "Ultimately, the Kriegsmarine will always be secondary to the Heer and the illustrious Luftwaffe. With the old guard and unreliable crews purged, we should begin the long-overdue process of reforming our naval command to correctly represent its position. We have had quite enough of salt-worn old men and disloyal, drunk sailors. Naturally, the most logical choice here is to put men who have experience in combat, organization and administration in charge, but there is currently a dearth of skilled seamen for some reason. Thankfully, the Führer knows plenty of talented and politically reliable men in the Luftwaffe who are due for promotions! These men will form a new board to replace the admiralty and ensure the swift reorganization and - more importantly - loyalty of our reborn Kriegsmarine."
 GGR_revive_the_freikorps_desc:0 "The Freikorps - nearly five decades have passed since their glory days, but the saviors of the Reich live on in the German cultural consciousness. Their victories over communism and the Jewry were forever immortalized by Hitler, and their deeds remain the bedrock of our National Socialist traditions. Freikorps membership, or descent from a Freikorps veteran, remains a marker of prestige in our society. None would question us, therefore, if we were to announce the reformation and formalization of this old paramilitary. To ordinary citizens, it would appear perfectly innocuous - a means by which to prepare as many people as possible for war and allow old soldiers to maintain their martial pride. To the Führer, however, it will be the largest and most well-trained militia force in history: a personal paramilitary at his beck and call. Our enemies will quake at our numbers, should further strife come!"
 GGR_arms_under_the_table_desc:0 "Strictly speaking, the Reich has a vested interest in keeping the capacity for violence among the populace at a low level. These are dire times, however, and the new Freikorps cannot afford to be bound by the same laws and regulations as civil organizations. Anything not being directed to the Wehrmacht should be funnelled to the militia; guns, grenades, trucks, even light vehicles and helicopters if possible! They must be a true fighting force, able to hold their own against anything the enemy might throw at them. Every militia fighter must be the equal of a hardened grenadier!"
 GGR_the_unsullied_service_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe, Göring's pride and joy, has always been loyal to him and always will be. He is their glorious father and their favorite son, marshal and veteran both. Schörner could never taint this branch of the military, the pinnacle of Aryan martial might! Organizing them for a possible conflict with the militarists will therefore be a simple matter - Göring speaks, and they obey. Air wings shall be recalled, Air Landing divisions put on standby and Fallschirmjäger roused from barracks. While loyalists in the other branches will undoubtedly have a role to play, it is the knights of the sky who will bring us final victory."
 GGR_protect_the_bases_desc:0 "Knowing that he could never sway them, it is likely that Schörner will instead try to sabotage the Luftwaffe by any means possible. Naturally for such a brutish man, his first choice will be to attack vulnerable bases and hangars, probably with commando units or bribed turncoats. Security at all key Luftwaffe facilities must be increased dramatically. It couldn't hurt to have better-armed units up to and including Panzer companies guarding them. Furthermore, security checks must be tightened up and base personnel monitored closely. Even a single broken link in the chain could have severe consequences for our beloved aviators."
 GGR_mark_targets_in_advance_desc:0 "Schörner has not yet begun to move against us openly, so there is no risk in scouting 'his' territory. It will be obvious to his clique what our reconnaissance aircraft are up to over their Reichskommissariats, but they wouldn't dare turn them back. While we do not expect Schörner to possess a significant air force of his own, the Abwehr has confirmed that he has been devising an answer to the Luftwaffe. His allies also possess large numbers of older aircraft, ostensibly to maintain control over their airspace. It is imperative that we find this mockery of the Luftwaffe wherever it hides and wipe it out the moment Schörner makes his bid for power."
 GGR_move_against_schorner_desc:0 "All possible preparations have been made and enough loyalties have been secured. With the more practical concerns taken care of, we have some administrative reorganization to do. Schörner's clique is deeply entrenched in OKW and in several important Reichskommissariats, which simply cannot continue. We must clear his toadies out of their positions and replace them with more loyal and controllable men of the Führer's own choosing. Schörner will push back against this as soon as he hears of it, but if we move quickly enough we should be able to completely displace his clique before he is prepared for open conflict."
 GGR_replace_the_field_marshal_desc:0 "Schörner once served ably, but no longer. Having lived through both World Wars, the West Russian War and all of the Reich's subsequent conquests, he is getting old and tired. Surely, the old warrior deserves peaceful semi-retirement in a quiet, less stressful role. Reichskommissariat Kamtschatka, perhaps? The Führer is certain that his old friend will be most grateful to have fewer commitments - and to be very, very, very far away from Germania. It's such a stressful place to live, after all."
 GGR_the_afrikajager_desc:0 "Siegfried Müller is incompetent, corrupt, treasonous and possibly the most pathetic excuse for a Reichskommissar in the entire Reich. His oversight of Zentralafrika turned out to be a complete sham and it is only by the Führer's mercy that he yet lives. However, his apparently undesirable traits also make him pliable and easy to control. He can be appeased with material wealth, has no grand ambitions, and his incompetence can be compensated for by delegating his duties. Müller is likely to be the worst Field Marshal the Reich will ever have, but he will certainly be the most useful."
 GGR_the_berliner_ratte_desc:0 "Hans Speidel is no friend of Göring, but he is easily the most competent candidate for the position of Field Marshal. With a long record of service and a reputation for honest patriotism, Speidel is immensely popular amongst both the populace and the Heer. Merely promoting him to the position of Field Marshal would be seen as a supremely wise and generous act, and could bring many militarists to heel. However, he might prove to be more trouble than he's worth; Speidel is a vocal critic of militarism and the Abwehr reports that he has always privately opposed the further expansion of German territory. He may not even be any more loyal than Schörner, in the end. That said, perhaps his principles will win out over his political opposition to Göring, and he will restrain himself appropriately."
 GGR_nepotism_desc:0 "Frankly, Göring has had enough of self-proclaimed 'suitable candidates'. All these ambitious, self-serving men squabbling to take Schörner's place - what good are they, really? How can any of them ever be trusted to abide by the Führer's directives? Any one of them could be another Schörner in waiting, another traitor seeking to stake his claim on the Führership! No, we need a good man, someone we can trust, someone who will neither challenge the Führer's right to rule or attempt to rock the boat.\n\nSomeone like... Theodore Göring, beloved nephew of the Führer! Under-qualified? Perhaps, but also reliable. Besides, who's to say he won't learn on the job?"
 GGR_ein_volk_ein_reich_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "At last! We had our doubts - our fears, even - that Schörner would not go quietly, that he would go to any lengths to dominate the Reich. The eruption of a second Bürgerkrieg seemed inevitable as the Field Marshal gathered his forces and rallied countless traitors to his banner. Those few enemies of the Reich who remain no doubt waited with bated breath to see our mighty empire fall to infighting once more.\n\nAnd yet, their dreams will never be realised. The treasonous Field Marshal has been unseated from his office and stripped of any capacity to wage war upon us, all without firing a shot! Relegated to the furthest reaches of Siberia and with his allies bought, bullied or broken, the monster in uniform will never again threaten the Führer's rightful mandate. Heil Göring!"
 GGR_test_their_loyalty_desc:0 "Since assuming power, the Führer has seen many new generals commissioned. The cream of the Reich's officer corps, these young men are all seasoned veterans of our many conquests, having learned as much on the battlefield as in the academies. Their loyalties remain undecided, likely due to their preoccupation leaving little time for politicking. Now, however, with Schörner's clique working to shore up their strength, the young generals have become a target for militarist intrigue. The traitor will surely attempt to bring them into his camp by any means necessary. We have to sway them before he has the chance - by hook, or by crook!"
 GGR_incentivize_the_new_guard_desc:0 "Despite their claims to be proud, principled men in the Prussian tradition, many of our new generals are anything but. Part of it is simply the nature of power; money is ultimately merely another means by which to acquire it. In that regard, it is no less effective a currency than blood. Those younger generals who are not yet wholly loyal to either Schörner or the Führer could be easily swayed in the latter's favour by the sweet allure of higher salaries and pensions, or even 'gifts' straight from his own purse. Making someone's life a little easier rarely goes unappreciated, after all..."
 GGR_a_little_extra_desc:0 "Some of today's young generals are unfortunately a little harder to please, as with the rest of their generation. They aren't content unless they're enjoying fine dining every night, cavorting with half a dozen high-class ladies and zooming around in the latest Mercedes sports cars. Though the older officers shake their heads and rant about the days of austerity under Hitler, the Führer understands the wants and needs of this new and talented generation of leaders. If they require even greater rewards to be satisfied, so be it. Fast cars, country estates, wine from the Führer's own cellar - whatever it takes, they must be loyal to us!"
 GGR_an_abundance_of_medals_desc:0 "The downside to being a newly-minted general these days is the unfortunate shortage of medals one can wear. Back in the days of the Empire, every general worth his salt would be absolutely festooned with medals and his uniform decorated with gold filigree. Only a few trembling old men can still boast such a grand panoply, and the younger generation of officers feel that they are unfairly compared to the old Prussian officer corps. In his generosity, the Führer has proclaimed that he will restore this proud aesthetic tradition. Henceforth, all deserving generals will have however many pieces of gold, silver and silk to decorate their uniforms as they feel is necessary - all that is necessary is for them to swear eternal allegiance to the one true Führer, Hermann Göring. For one's glory to be so resplendent, is that so high a price?"
 GGR_we_know_where_you_live_desc:0 "Gold, jewelry and fine wine? Who do these upstart generals think they are, middle-aged bourgeoise housewives? The true German officer needs no incentive beyond patriotism! If he cannot find it within himself to devote the entirety of his being to the Reich, then perhaps he needs a little reminder of what is at stake! There will be no tolerance for preening, vainglorious children within the Wehrmacht's command structure; they will serve because the Führer demands it! All suspect officers will be closely monitored by the Gestapo, and any cowardice, corruption or disloyalty duly punished by the most severe means possible!"
 GGR_and_youre_families_desc:0 "Some young officers think themselves brave. With their egos bloated by their rank and rewards, they believe that they are above discipline and loyalty. Not even the harshest threats to their livelihoods are taken seriously, perhaps due to our historically lax attitude towards officer autonomy under the militarists. They will soon learn that Göring is not Schörner - he does not tolerate his subordinates living corrupt lives as petty kings of their divisions. If threatening their persons is insufficient, perhaps their families should become involved in present matters. After all, isn't family the core of Aryan values?"
 GGR_never_look_the_other_way_desc:0 "Though we have always tried to be merciful to the lesser races of the world, it is an unfortunate reality that many are as recalcitrant children who refuse to acknowledge their betters. Well, as the saying goes: "Spare the rod, spoil the child." We have been tolerant up to this point, but recently some of our subject peoples have been far too uncooperative - even violent. We cannot show weakness in this crucial time; we must discipline these ungrateful savages with bullet and bayonet! Some might balk at this task, but there are a number of officers in the Schörnerite tradition who will follow any order, no matter how harsh or - in the eyes of weak foreigners - inhumane."
 GGR_trials_for_warcrimes_desc:0 "Shocking! A number of our best officers, once thought loyal and true paragons of the Reich, have been directly implicated in horrific war crimes against non-Aryan populations! That something like this could have happened on Schörner's watch is unthinkable - how could any good, honest German ever succumb to such violence and depravity? State media will make this outrage known to the whole Reich, and the guilty parties arrested and brought to trial immediately! National Socialism does not permit acts of senseless brutality and genocide, and nor will the Führer!"
 GGR_reward_faithful_service_desc:0 "Many of the Führer's closest followers have been with him for decades. These officers have proven their loyalty time and time again, supporting him in the dark days of the Bürgerkrieg and beyond. The bravest and truest of Germany's soldiers, their time to be justly rewarded has finally come. Medals and financial benefits are not enough - these men simply must have their own Reichskommissariats! Is there any more comfortable and well-deserved retirement than to manage one of our prosperous and hard-won colonies?"
 GGR_governor_generals_desc:0 "There was a lot of debate within the Führer's cabinet about where to send our new Reichskommissars. After all, we have already allocated all of our conquests to RKs, or annexed them into the Reich. Then, a stroke of genius struck the Führer: Central Asia! It remains one of the most ill-managed and rebellious areas in the greater Reich, probably due to the overstretched and weary administration. The logical solution to the problem is, naturally, to divide the region into four new Reichskommissariats, thereby killing two birds with one stone; the administrative issues will be solved, and our generals will have their promised fiefdoms far, far away from Germania."
 GGR_wandering_minds_desc:0 "The Führer has been notified of an unfortunate occurrence in our logistics department: the new Reichskommissars report that their troops are severely under-equipped! This is truly a tragedy, but how could it have happened? All the paperwork on Germania's end show that the required equipment was shipped out on schedule. Perhaps there was some error, or the trains delivered their cargo to the wrong place? Well, never mind. This will soon be resolved - the Führer himself has pledged to oversee all future deliveries of equipment to Central Asia personally! Our men can rest easy knowing that he's on the job!"

 GGR_ein_fuhrer_desc:0 "Treason without compare has struck the Reich once more - we are again engulfed in civil war! The traitor Hans Speidel has risen up in rebellion, and the former Field Marshal, Ferdinand Schörner, has established himself as a rival claimant to the Führership! We have come so far, conquered so much in the name of National Socialism and the Aryan race; we cannot afford to fail now!\n\nOur great Führer has led us through trials to eclipse even the World Wars! He has defeated fleets of thousands - crushed rock and metal and bone beneath the grinding treads of the Wehrmacht! His reign will not end this way, not at their hands! The world he has built will endure for a thousand years! Sieg heil!"
 GGR_the_key_to_victory_desc:0 "Schörner might have his conscript hordes, but we are the sole bearers of the Germanic martial tradition. No violent thug pressed into service and armed with a rifle produced in some god-forsaken Reichskommissariat can hope to match a true son of Germany. We will demonstrate to the world once and for all that German steel, backed by German discipline, is the finest in the world! Only ensuring the continuation of our tradition of high-quality soldiers and equipment will keep us safe from the tide of treachery rising around us."
 GGR_is_on_the_workfloor_desc:0 "German industry remains unrivalled, and we must keep it that way to secure victory! Our factories are filled with strong, dedicated working men, but they slacken and grow restless as word of the war reaches them - this is unacceptable! The bosses must drive them to work harder than ever before, for every bullet that arrives too late could see another valiant soldier of the Reich murdered by the traitors. Failure to dedicate one's entire heart and soul to work in this crucial time is tantamount to desertion, and will be punished as such!"
 GGR_supplies_from_ukraine_desc:0 "An unfortunate but unavoidable side-effect of the Reich's recent expansion is the stretching of our supply lines and the shortage of vital resources accompanying it. The traitors have access to all the industry and resources within the lands they illegally hold, including those which are central to the war effort! Thankfully, with Ukraine secured for the rightful Führer, its vast supplies of oil, steel and grain remain available to us - a very useful thing indeed, with our lands once again riven by war. The Balkans remain secure and difficult for any invader to take, so our eastern supply lines will be redirected to travel through that region alone. We cannot afford further shortages now."
 GGR_is_on_the_frontline_desc:0 "Our soldiers have fought long and hard, many for years on end. Still, we must demand one more great effort from the Heer. No matter how many officers and spoilt, ungrateful grunts have defected, the truest and noblest of the Grenadiers remain at our side. It is they who shall carry us to victory, and all possible measures must be taken to maximize their potential. Whether that is wages to keep them loyal, food to keep them happy or Pervitin to keep them awake and active, the loyal soldiery will have what they require, and give their all in thanks to the Führer! In this hour, no alternative to absolute dedication is permissible."
 GGR_soldiers_from_the_balkans_desc:0 "The Balkan Garrison is the hard core of the Wehrmacht. Cornwall might have been the best posting, but no amount of watching over shepherds and fishermen could make that garrison the match of the Balkan men! Those grizzled veterans have been fighting a ceaseless guerilla war against rebellious subhumans and Bolshevik partisans for nearly thirty years. More importantly, they have remained at arm's length from the political intrigues of Germania; they are a strictly loyal and obedient force of soldiers and airmen at the Führer's beck and call. It's a good thing that we have subdued all major partisan groups in the region, for men such as they are needed more now than ever. They will be recalled to the Reich and placed directly on the frontlines - the traitors will have a nasty surprise waiting for them if they expected green conscripts!"
 GGR_no_more_militarists_desc:0 "The question of how to deal with the traitor Speidel has been a frequent topic of discussion within OKW. The answer, of course, is obvious: no talks with turncoats! The Führer recognizes that no military man ambitious enough to take independent action can ever be trusted. As though the simple act of treason were not bad enough, Speidel is an infamous crypto-Speerite who has time and again questioned the core tenets of National Socialism! Some say he even refuses to accept our deserved right to rule over the lesser races of the world! We will crush this German Judas and all who follow him, as we would any other enemy of the Fatherland!"
 GGR_talk_to_the_rat_desc:0 "Hans Speidel is a traitor, but he is nowhere near as dangerous as Schörner. Speerism is all but dead; he represents no ideological threat to us, only a minor strategic one. Perhaps his apolitical nature and dedication to the preservation of German lives can be turned to our advantage. Schörner represents a threat not only to our new order, but also to the Reich itself - his deranged ambition would see countless millions thrown into the meat grinder for no tangible gain whatsoever! Speidel is not a strong-willed man, and an appeal of equal parts reason and logic might sway him to at least refrain from attacking us and focus his forces on Schörner instead. We can ill afford a war on three fronts, after all..."
 GGR_drive_out_the_villains_desc:0 "The presence of traitors' feet on German soil is a grave insult to the honor of our race and nation. With every day that passes, more gullible fools flock to their banners, spreading the twin poisons of militarism and pacifism. The Führer has thus decreed the immediate formulation and execution of a plan to push the renegades out of the Fatherland itself. This will be a legendary cleansing, the likes of which have not been seen since the Bürgerkrieg, to purify Germany of its ills and carve in history the eternal glory and righteousness of our one true Führer! No mercy will be shown to the bearers of this rot and decay, who threaten the very foundations of our world!"
 GGR_germany_under_one_banner_desc:0 "Our situation remains precarious, but the worst of the fires have been extinguished as the traitors have been driven from the Reich proper. Our forces have completely secured the German heartlands and are now busying themselves with mopping up the last holdouts and partisan cells. Speidel and Schörner have fled like the cowards they are, but their forces are already rallying in the Reichskommissariats aligned to their respective sides. Owing to the breadth of our conquests and the chronic disloyalty of the various Reichskommissars, they remain in possession of a great deal of land, resources and manpower. The fight must be taken beyond Germany, but it will be a long, hard road to victory from here on out."
 GGR_use_the_slaves_desc:0 "What is a slave but a machine made of meat, to be used and discarded as its master wishes? Even with our healthy surplus, we have historically placed too much value on the lives and wellbeing of slaves, thinking of them as a precious commodity - this lax attitude ends now! They are a resource to be spent as necessary, and there is no shortage of cheap fuel for war's furnace these days. We must purge the last vestiges of sympathy for these subhumans from our society and put them to maximum possible use; no more breaks, sleep, food or even water unless they prove their particular value. For every fleshy machine that breaks down, there are millions more available to replace it, so why fret over a few more bodies committed to the crematoriums every day?"
 GGR_punish_the_deserters_desc:0 "As the war rages on, the chaff separates from the wheat. Accounts reach us of entire battalions defecting, refusing to follow orders or even retreating without permission. The snake Schörner has always been right about one thing, at least - acts of supreme cowardice cannot be tolerated. Harsh punishments for deserters have been the norm for decades, but with the very existence of the Reich on the line, all disciplinary efforts must be redoubled! If a thousand must die to push a million forward, then so be it! Anyone who refuses to serve in combat will serve on the firing line!"
 GGR_harsher_quotas_desc:0 "Even citizen and volunteer workers continually fail to meet our requirements and expectations! It is shocking and disgraceful to see this kind of unpatriotic laziness in vital war industries, especially considering the stakes of the current conflict. Henceforth, proper military discipline will be employed in all industries, and quotas raised to the necessary levels. For a working man to give anything less than the entirety of his being to the national effort is just as treasonous as siding with the enemy! We'll instate 18-hour working days if we have to; nothing less than total militarization of the factories will bring us victory!"
 GGR_attack_the_pacifists_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact of human nature that the common people never really want war. More often than not, they merely lust for the idea of crushing and dominating their nation's enemies. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? However, it is not the soft-hearted masses that dictate policy, but the Führer! The weakling pacifists infesting the Reich's heartland are as much a threat to the morale of our nation as deserters and cowards - thankfully, there is an easy way to turn the people against them and bring the populace to the Führer's bidding. All we need do is remind the people of this war's true stakes, which will expose the pacifists' lack of patriotism and endangerment of the nation. This has never failed us before, and once carried out will ensure that nobody will complain when those treasonous scum are dragged from their houses and shot as the cowards they are."
 GGR_men_on_the_frontlines_desc:0 "What do we even have men in the factories for? What value does a man truly hold if he will not don a helmet and carry a rifle into combat for the sake of his country? We face a life or death struggle for the future of the Reich - now is the hour for each and every true Aryan man to live up to the standards envisioned by the great Hitler! We need everyone to fight this war - from every floor of every factory in every Gau! Any who refuse to down their ploughshares for swords will be considered traitors to the cause and dealt with appropriately!"
 GGR_women_in_the_factories_desc:0 "The Aryan-Feminists bleated for years about wanting the opportunity to work in factories like their husbands; now, they shall have it. With the men shipped off to more suitable occupations, we have a skilled labor shortage that slaves cannot fulfil. True, these women are lacking in experience and the strength of soul that makes men superior workers, but this is Judgement Day for the Reich! Extreme measures must be taken at home just as readily as on the frontlines, and if that includes violating sacrosanct gender roles, then so be it."
 GGR_pows_in_the_camps_desc:0 "All these captured traitors are languishing in POW camps, eating our bread and occupying our guards. That bread should be going to the troops, those guards should be fighting for the Reich, and those prisoners should be making themselves useful! If they would claim to be the true sons of Germany, then let them try and prove it in the work camps! Perhaps their claims will be verified, or maybe they will redeem themselves through back-breaking labor - "Work will set you free", after all. While we're at it, perhaps the numerous civilians who have yet to prove their worth should be... redefined. Redefined as Schörnerite spies, for instance, rather than mere cowards and slackers."

 GGR_ein_reich_desc:0 "Once more, the Reich has fallen into chaos. Göring may have been our preferred stalking horse in the Reichstag but his gluttony and incompetence have cost us dearly. His economic mismanagement has sunk the Reich to a new low, his flamboyance and extravagance emptying its coffers and putting its slaves into open revolt. The German people have been infected with his laziness, his femininity, and his cowardice. Fortunately there is no character so low that righteous war cannot rectify it."
 GGR_stand_for_your_fatherland_desc:0 "Most of our citizens have sat idle these past few years, content to let slaves do the work. The Wehrmacht has become the only constant, always requiring more men to maintain the balance of our empire. It is vital that the people understand the importance of what we do, that they join us in our purging of the rot that has corrupted the Reich. Goebbels may be long dead but his lessons hold true - the people must be galvanised by propaganda. Let the posters and banners fly. It is better they make the choice to enlist on their own. It lets them think they still have a choice."
 GGR_war_in_the_factories_desc:0 "This is a total war. Goebbels understood the value of making the war felt by everyone, from the front lines to the fields to the factories. We must ensure our workers know the importance of their labour, and redouble their efforts to produce arms for the fatherland. The factory floor will be reorganised into a home front, with clear ranks established for every worker. Work squads will be directed at their tasks by floor sergeants, and every task will be timed down to the minute, ensuring when a mistake is made it will not be made again. When we are done, the production line will be indistinguishable from the front line."
 GGR_war_in_the_fields_desc:0 "Out here in the fields, you fight for your meals. All one can see for miles on end is the Reich. All one sees is the front line. Europe is consumed in warfare once more, and it is essential that the soldiers understand that.\n\nIf we do not hold Ukraine, whose bread will feed their families back home? Danish pork and butter are a staple at every table, Bohemian cars fill the streets of every city, Baltic farms are home to a cousin of every other man in this army. If we do not win this war, we risk losing everything the Reich has fought for for the past century. We fight for what is ours."
 GGR_war_in_the_mind_desc:0 "This war is perhaps the most important we have ever fought. If the Reich cannot be halted in its fall, if Göring and Speidel are allowed to continue to destroy it then all is lost and the Führer's dream will be dead. Our troops must understand this - they must not falter in their mission, they must show no mercy, and they must never surrender. Thus far they have been found lacking. The number of rounds wasted on deserters is too high when they could be put to use against the enemy. We shall require our troops swear oaths of loyalty, and officers instructed to keep a closer eye on their men. And every man will keep an eye on his comrades - for there are traitors around every street corner."
 GGR_volkssturm_desc:0 "To achieve a great future blood must be spilled. Just because one is not eligible for conscription into the Wehrmacht does not mean one cannot be of use to their country. The Volkssturm shall serve as a home for those too old for the Wehrmacht, those too infirm to drill with a rifle and those women who are called upon to serve the Reich in its time of great need. Though their equipment may be lacking in quality, their training substandard and their uniforms virtually nonexistent, they will fill holes in the line just as well as any Heer Soldat. It will serve as a useful means of disposal for critical of our way of thinking."
 GGR_all_traitors_shall_bleed_desc:0 "Our efforts have proven successful so far, with the flow of fresh recruits to the front line broadening into a torrent. There will always be elements of cowardice that must be rooted out however - the common soldier must be taught the value of discipline and diligence. Anyone attempting to undermine the war effort, by words or by actions, is a traitor and will be treated as such. The Reich is a machine of flesh and metal, and when a cog gets stuck or a spring breaks, you replace it. We have neither the time nor the inclination to waste our efforts with trials or prisons. Shoot them."
 GGR_those_without_desc:0 "We had hoped that Göring would prove a willing ally as Führer - while he may be vain and gauche he is a military man. Sadly it was not to be, his leadership limp-wristed, his monetary management ham-fisted and his policies ill-thought. He has proven truculent in our attempts to steer him and now he has bucked the reins and risks bringing the Reich we have fought so hard for crashing into a ditch. He must die, and those that followed him in life will follow him to the firing line.\n\nEnding that glory hound Speidel will merely be the cherry on top of the cake. From the battlefields of the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line to the balconies of the Berghof he has followed us, always casting his shadow. He has hindered us for too long, and it will be a pleasure to see him swinging from a rope. "
 GGR_and_those_within_desc:0 "Examples have been made, and we have been patient enough. Soldiers linger away from their duties, eager to spend as much time away from the front as possible. They make excuses, hide in their barracks, spend time on frivolities like lunch breaks. No longer. Spare time is wasted time, and wasted time is dereliction of duty.\n\nThe newly issued 'Richtlinien für die Behandlung der Zeitverschwender' will crack down on these time wasters. Any soldier found away from the front lines without written orders from a superior officer will be hanged. Any officer who fails to carry out these orders will be shot. What more fitting punishment for those who refuse to defend German women and children?"
 GGR_no_retreat_desc:0 "This front is too vital to fall without a fight. No matter how many men they throw at us, no matter how many bodies we must expend, we will bleed for every second we must buy for our forces across the Reich to muster against the enemy. There will be not one step back for our men, not until they reach the very walls of [ROOT.Capital.GetName].\n\nOf course, the Reichsmarshall and his staff are too vital to leave to the enemy. They will evacuate when the time is right. "
 GGR_shorten_the_chain_of_command_desc:0 "Even we are willing to admit the Wehrmacht has become somewhat bloated since its glory days in the forties. Our ranks are filled with upjumped, inexperienced officers who scarcely remember the Second World War, let alone the first. They are more a hindrance than a help - what use can they be commanding men in combat if they have never seen the front lines?\n\nWe shall do them a favour and shorten the chain of command. Those without experience will be demoted to NCO ranks, those that complain will find themselves no different to the Soldaten they once commanded. Perhaps if they survive, they can work their way back up the ranks."
 GGR_slaves_on_the_frontline_desc:0 "Slaves are one of the few things we have in abundance. They may be lazy and insubordinate, their work shoddy and substandard, but they provide the majority of the Reich's labour. They are many and individually quite worthless - it would be a mistake not to utilise them in our hour of need. Their blood is inferior but they take a bullet just as well as any Aryan.\n\nPromise them freedom, or food, or a day off - we have no obligation to follow through. March them at gunpoint and send them at the enemy barricades. Every one that dies is a German life saved, and maybe after the war there won't be so many of them to worry about."
 GGR_nowhere_left_to_run_desc:0 "A cornered dog is the most dangerous kind. Every man, woman and child here knows their duty, to defend this land to their dying breath, and with all avenues of escape cut off even the most desperate coward must stand and fight. When men are ordered to march, we expect them to march. When they are ordered to kill, we expect that they kill. And when they are ordered to die, we expect them to die. Any less is treason."
 GGR_a_lost_cause_desc:0 "The situation here has become untenable. The front lines are dissolving, with deserters fleeing faster than our blocking squads can shoot them. All the same, we can ensure the enemy gains nothing of value from this land. Land mines and indiscriminate artillery fire will slow their advance long enough to extract men and materiel, while we set light to the fields and salt the earth beneath with defoliants. Ammo dumps will be rigged with time delayed bombs, sending any would-be scavengers to kingdom come. There is always the next Reichskommissariat."
 GGR_exhaust_the_workers_desc:0 "Scorched earth tactics do not merely extend to the land itself. Blood and soil are inextricably linked - it would be ridiculous to burn the crops and leave those who tend them to replant them the next day. They must be wrung for every last drop of effort before we evacuate, every ounce of arms and armaments and supplies taken. If they must work in double shifts to ensure that we eventually take the helm, so be it. When we return they will no doubt be grateful we spared their lives."
 GGR_dispose_of_the_useless_desc:0 "Slaves have always been disposable - that is their purpose. If we cannot take them with us to the next front, so be it. Round them up and put a bullet in them before we leave. The work camps they once occupied are valuable assets and it would be foolish to leave them intact for the next contender. Shell them, bomb them, set them alight. There is no sense in evacuating those with no reason to live."
 GGR_burn_capital_desc:0 "A capital is temporary, for we are always on the march. If this one does not suit us we will find a new one, one more suitable for our needs. Of course, it would be hypocritical to leave this city intact and ready starve when we have demolished the factories and salted the earth behind us in the name of a better Reich. They do not even have slaves any more. It is kinder to set it alight behind us when we leave."

GGR_ein_volk_desc:0 "The Madness of Göring and Schörner has collapsed like a house of cards. Now once again Germans are shooting on Germans. The failure of National Socialism in its current state is evident. Now it falls to Speidel to restore the Reich to some semblance of sanity. If that means reform then so be it. Working with students, working with partisans or even abandoning RK's outright. The Reich will be reformed into something more reasonable. It doesn't have a choice."
GGR_promises_of_freedom_desc:0 "If the German people as well as all the other people currently within the Reich want to see their chains broken and a measure of freedom restored, then they have no choice, but to stay with us. While our promises have to be vague at the moment, once we have triumphed over Schörner and Göring surely we will reform the Reich into something more "pleasant" than what it has been in the past."
GGR_rally_the_army_desc:0 "While a lot of the army still follows Schörner or Göring, even the forces that have joined us are still somewhat reluctant to accept Speidel as their new leader. In this critical situation we can't afford to let lingering distrust impact our effort to save the Reich. Let's remind them, that Speidel is the saviour of Germania during the first civil war, the vanquisher of Himmler's coup during the West russian War and that now he will save Germany once again. Unsere letzte Hoffnung heißt Speidel."
GGR_rally_the_students_desc:0 "The students of the Reich have suffered much in the recent years, between the first Civil War, Göring's crackdown and being sent off to die in the various wars. Hence their distrust of any Wehrmacht general, even one that actually wants to improve their situation is natural. Speidel will have a lot of convincing to do to gain their support. However if they want to see reform of the Reich within their lifetime then they will have no choice but to support Speidel. "
GGR_a_united_front_desc:0 "It took a lot of talking, haggling and pleading, but finally the Students and the parts of the Wehrmacht that have sided with us have agreed to form a united front against our enemies. Its condition is still brittle, but with time and hopefully success it will form into a front of solid iron that will have the strength to do what it must: Save the Reich from its current self."
GGR_call_to_the_partisans_desc:0 "While dealing with the various collaborators that have supported Reich, Speidel has inevitably gotten contact with various groups that are willing to rise up as partisans, but whoms ideological composition is not so far away as to be untenable. Directly helping potential enemies of the Reich might not be the clean choice, but giving a hand to let these partisan groups rise up in our current enemies territory can prove very valuable."
GGR_the_iberians_desc:0 "Ever since Iberia fell to our invasion, the peninsula has become a mess of partisans and garrisons fighting it out. With the Civil War this situation only intensified. With the number and variety of resistance organizations very large, it is easy to simply support a few of those to rise up in pro-Schörner and pro-Göring controlled areas, but not in ours."
GGR_the_slavs_desc:0 "The Schörner controlled areas include many of the former and current slavic inhabited lands. Having them rise up in an attempt to liberate their lands is not only likely to happen with or without our help, if we give them a bit of support here and there, they will likely draw away a significant amount of hostile forces away from our current areas of engagement. And no matter who wins, we can just deal with them afterwards."
GGR_the_scandinavians_desc:0 "Scandinavia, especially the valuable mines of Lappland and northern Sweden have seen large influxes of slave workers recently. With the territory being lowly populated, vast in scale and difficult to control, it is a prime area for an uprising. A bit of help here and there can help this to come about quicker. Still the emptiness of the region will prevent the uprising from spreading too far into our own areas of control."
GGR_all_for_a_prosperous_europe_desc:0 "With various partisan uprisings as well as our own war effort underway, a glorious future for Europe might now be within reach. Speidel's Germany and its vision is clear: All of Europe shall become prosperous once more under our leadership, the leadership of the Einheitspakt"
GGR_know_when_to_fight_desc:0 "This war is not yet over! We may have been pushed back and delayed temporarily, but we will fight on from one of those Reichskommissariat loyal to us. And there are enough of those around that we can repeat that process time and time again. Still we will fight to the last for the vision that Hans Speidel represents: A Reich of reason and not of madness that can hold up to all challenges."
GGR_call_troops_from_overseas_desc:0 "The fight for the heart of the Reich is the most important front in this whole conflict, but where Speidel is also important. We should recall troops from overseas and those areas less relevant to our cause and concentrate on securing our central area of operations."
GGR_the_saviour_of_germany_desc:0 "He is the saviour of the West Russian war, He is the protector of Germania, He is our last hope for change in the Reich, He is Hans Speidel! His popularity has to be emphasized and used, if we want to have a chance in fighting this war. Lets use all available means for a morale boosting campaign. All hail Speidel saviour and regenerator of the Reich."
GGR_and_to_withdraw_desc:0 "It is no shame to withdraw when you have to. There are others on our side who can carry on the fight. And just such a situation is happening right now. We have to leave, before the situation becomes bad enough, that even an orderly evacuation is impossible. Speidel will leave, but rest assured that he will return."
GGR_evacuate_the_troops_desc:0 "While the struggle over here is turning out less than favourable to us, our friends and forces overseas are doing much better, especially if those forces that remain can be transported over to them. Thus that is what we will do. Ready the troops and ready the ships, it is time to defend Germany elsewhere!"
GGR_native_rule_desc:0 "Our conventional and symmetric method of warfare has failed in this region. We now have no choice but to retreat elsewhere to fight another day. The natives of the nation have no such luxury however, defeat or not they will fight to live another day. Leaving them some equipment we can't afford to evacuate in such a short time, surely will help them to continue their resistance against our mutual enemies, long after we have left."
GGR_evacuation_desc:0 "It's over and this RK has fallen. Help is on the way to evacuate us, if only we can hold out long enough. 84 days. Just 84 days and we are saved."

The second is Turkey, which is famed for its vital chromium mines and dominance of the Bosphorus strait, as well as a land border with the Italians, which could prove to be most useful in the future. Last is the cursed Slavs to our east; the Siberian plains are rich in resources and enemies alike. We shouldn't neglect these flies, they must be crushed if we are to secure our eastern borders once and for all.\n\nOnce we have crushed and secured all of the aforementioned foes, we should be more than ready to tackle our rivals to our south!

Somehow, our Welthauptstadt has remained relatively unharmed in the civil war, and citizens of Speidel's territory has hailed the militarymen as heroes for saving the city.\n\nTo finish this conflict and bring about a new order in the world, we must ask Speidel and his men to stand down and let us enter.

And from the universities and schools, what remained of the student movement emerged with a renewed defiance against the victorious lion, the promised Führer of a new Fatherland.\n\nIt was a surprise to see them still alive. Nobody really thought they would keep on with their passionate stand against the militarist forces of Göring. And yet, here they were.\n\nTheir numbers grew and their protests spread. Soldiers and policemen rushed to meet them, to keep them from accomplishing what they hoped for. Some succeeded but others were not; for every demonstration they crushed with the club or the rifle, there were two more which crushed them back with the petrol bomb or the rock.\n\nJust like the embers of a dying fire made fresh again with air and fuel, so were the students who stole weapons from the dead or fleeing security forces. Just like the rising form of a phoenix, the students, filled with rage that only comes as a second wind, denounced the victors and threatened the returning peace.\n\nThis all shook up the German people once more. They watched from their broken windows or from their dirty workplaces as these young men and women tried to fight again for what they stood for. Most of them wanted peace, for this to finally come to an end, even if Göring was the one victorious and not Speer, Heydrich nor Bormann.\n\n"Give it up already!" some would tell the students, "The war is over! What's left for you to fight for?" And in response, there was only contemptuous silence or a barrage of proclamations, all rebellious, that defied what was already set in stone. Yet, the students would keep on marching, protesting, fighting back. Even if it meant their death or a fate much worse, they didn't seem to have any other choice. To capitulate was anathema to them; to not dissent was more outrageous than it is to stand up to what's happened, even in defeat."

Strongly. I'll personally see to it."\n\nThe former pilot with grizzled hair blinked at him. Then he chuckled, shrugged, and said, "Really. Very well then. I give you the liberty of doing what must be done. Just don't take too long, all right?"\n\n"Of course not." Schörner thought his new Führer a little too histrionic. Well, not a big deal.

The sooner those pests and their supporters are taken care of, the sooner our country can lick its wounds and get to work," the Führer said, all too quickly. The field marshal looked up. Then he gave a nod. Schörner saluted him. He turned away and marched off, Göring watching him disappear.\n\nThe old, great lion who won the war for Germany's conquests to be added to now twisted the knob of the door and stepped in.

There, their virgin hands shall labor; there, their big brains shall wonder about the measure of their rations and the weight of their loads; and there, they shall learn all about the rewards of placing their hopes in a cowardly old man who has never served the Fatherland except to save himself and his wretched thralls.\n\nIf they do figure out what is right for them, then they better work hard and stop complaining about the fucking slaves and the stupid natives. Until they accept what's good for them and their peers, they don't deserve to be restored into the Fatherland's tent again. If they don't get that into their thick skulls, there won't be any escape from the mouths of the lions and wolves who are certainly better than them.\n\nThe roundup of these annoying students and their leaders shall be a simple thing to carry out. If they resist, they're to be shot. If they give in, they're guilty enough to be sent to the camps.\n\nYet, it just isn't enough to discipline these upstarts of that bloody architect. There is no excuse for the youth who failed to persuade their naive classmates from rebellion. They too are guilty for their reluctance.\n\nAt least we won't worry about funding those fancy universities now. Their beloved professors can sit on their desks and spin on their chalks.

Now he reigned the Fatherland in his wake. Even if they do whatever spineless things they are perfectly capable of doing, they won't get the chance, not when he starts pressing his black boot against their necks. And that is despite his own dream of reshaping the economy of the Reich. Without them, he shall be master of the Reich's wealth, free to use it for his own purposes and the greater needs of the people.\n\nFor now, it was important to really sink the teeth of the state into their assets and their very persons. He ordered no mercy in his pronunciations against the hoard rats. He denounced them for their "crimes against the personal wealth of each and every German citizen." And he insulted them as economists and monetarists who are as corrupt as the Jews. He even went so far as to accuse them of serving themselves; of being under the dirty paws of Jews - if they were not Jewish themselves.\n\nAnd naturally, they were swiftly dealt with in any manner available. From simply refusing to do business with them up to crafting unfortunate accidents that befell them, the good Führer would let these slide. As long as they help him throw those rapacious financiers out of society, he would not need to apply Germany's justice against them.\n\nAfter all, the natural enemy of the Fatherland was not those who served the Führer's interests but those who sought to be opportunistic; to squeeze them out like the thieves they are, returning their booty to those who rightfully possess it. That is how Göring and the Fatherland made new shall prevail in the absence of those goblins."

Entrances, exits, pathways, and obstacles; he stopped to look forward and walked to the front, then turned sharply, facing the center.\n\nHe let his left hand reach down, groping at an empty belt. The man bit his lower lip, remembering that he was not in a place that allowed for weapons. This was a school, the thought came across his mind. You'll get it back.\n\nThe professor spoke to his students, who either seemed intimidated by this visitor or, perhaps, excited. A few showed no emotion, only curiosity.\n\nThe man waited for his own chance to speak. Patiently, of course. But the way the man spoke, with its awe; its naivety; its ignorance - his voice annoyed him. His left hand groped for the empty space by his belt once more. Nothing to hold; nothing to bring up and shoulder; nothing to give him some measure of control, of safety. Just as sweat dropped down his neck.\n\nWhen the older man stopped speaking and returned to his seat, the soldier - an experienced rifleman who had served as the Fatherland saw fit for him to serve in whatever place, then serving once more to win the Fatherland for the new Führer - stiffened.\n\nThoughts raced through his head, as bullets once did by his ears. A nervousness rang as ruined bells inside his equally ruined mind. And the full measure of the past rose back up to the surface, tormenting him with the truths of war as these students seemed not to really comprehend anything at all.\n\nThis war of mine, he said to himself, reminding his conscience, is not theirs to thoroughly appreciate. He wished himself to will through and speak about his experiences as they were to him; raw, brutal, and traumatic. But the state would not permit it; war was a glorious thing, as the new Führer declared for a new Germany.\n\nHis left hand pressed against his thigh. And he began to speak, choosing to lie to them - to lull them into the dream of conquest and of power they wanted to believe.

In a terrifying case, a Battalion was issued Second World War era Kar98s that had somehow been assembled with the bolts from Russian Mosin-Nagants, leading to six deaths as the rifles catastrophically failed. This specific case is just one of many considering the deluge of reports about anti-tank rockets failing to launch and exploding a foot away from the launcher; hand grenades with faulty fuses exploding in our grenadiers hands; or panzer engines self-immolating the second they are moved from their railway wagons.\n\nMany generals are now pointing fingers at the Führer's removal of skilled personnel from the factories to form scratch battalions as a cause for these problems. Field Marshal Schörner privately spoke out today about the decision to remove skilled workers, and condemned it in a meeting of concerned generals."

The office of the Führer stated that rations would be maintained at their current level but would attempt to ensure an even distribution.\n\nToday Führer Göring condemned the practice and asked for the Army to spare the truly loyal Germans from such treatment, many have noted that Field Marshal Schörner and many of the Reich's top generals are remaining silent on the issue."

These feelings of discontent have experienced a sharp rise after a particularly serious accident at the Mauser Works, where four workers died after a ton of ammunition exploded during transit. \nSpeaking in confidence many workers stated that they felt like slaves, pushed to their breaking point and unappreciated by the leadership. Further reports point fingers to what appear to be a conspiracy of war profiteering with many employers failing to pay out wages or ration cards.\n\nField Marshal Schörner issued a damning statement today an hour ahead of the scheduled Führer address.

Following the Field Marshal, Germany's loyal Generals took their place either side of a red carpet leading to a great podium erected in the Großer Platz.\n\nThe Germania philharmonic orchestra struck up Wagner's 'Die Walküre' as 100 spotlights illuminated the gathering darkness in pillars of light, recalling the 1935 party rally. At this signal, a flight of helicopters swooped over the Avenue of Splendours, with the Führer's own helicopter landing gracefully in the Großer Platz. To cries of "Heil Göring" the Führer made his way to the podium, receiving the salute of the assembled Generals. Retiring General Rommel then presented the Führer with the keys to Germania, formally welcoming the Führer to his rightful place in the capital.\n\nThe Führer then made his first official address to the nation. "Germany, today we light a fire that will never be extinguished! The traitor's sickness has been cut out, Speer and Bormann have fled in disgrace and Heydrich has vanished at his master's call!

In some of the largest gatherings of non-military persons in several years, the Humboldt University Students' Union has gathered near and around the Kleiner Tiergarten. According to local reports the gathering is largely peaceful with the exception of loud chanting and terrible youth music.\n\nThe Führer's office has surprisingly declined to issue a statement on the student protests. Germanian police have largely acted only to cordon the protests off the and prevent them from moving towards Germania Mitte. Protests also seem to be forming in other major population centres, including one in the wartime capital Hamburg. \nRather than violently suppressing the protests as expected, the Germanian police seem to be remarkably tolerant of these protests, with only a scattered handful of arrests carried out today.."

Göring had not had the chance to indulge himself in such a manner since before the Civil War, and this occasion was the perfect opportunity to present his grandeur as the new master of Germany to the people, and more importantly, to the military.\n\nNormally, the promotion of an officer, even an exceptional one as was the case here, would not call for such pageantry. Or at least that would be the state of affairs under Hitler, but Göring was not Hitler, and that was no secret. His passion for opulence and appearance was a critical factor in all that he did and now that he was free to do as he pleased, public events would become much more frequent and much more grandiose. Besides, the Führer wished to celebrate those officers who had served him so well against the traitors.\n\nHans Speidel called from a roll, "Johannes Steinhoff, step forward." Speidel's presence was supremely important. These were the officers that were selected to counterbalance Schörner's clique, whether for their support for Göring or Speidel didn't matter as long as they were not lackeys of the Chief of the OKW. The man that had just called up was one of those handpicked by the Führer himself. Steinhoff, like himself, had the blood of a pilot through and through, and Göring had already marked him as one to keep close by his side. This promotion would allow the much-deserving man to lead the Luftwaffe to glory as now that Göring was above personally directing its actions. More importantly, it would give Göring a much-needed reprieve from the duties of the office.\n\nThe Führer smiled as he placed the shoulder straps of a General der Luftwaffe on Steinhoff's uniform and gave him an almost paternal pat on the back as the newly-minted general moved to retake his seat. Göring would make the Wehrmacht his own, officer by officer. Speidel checked Steinhoff's name, and moved to the next one down."

He found such an act not only soothing, but a blessed relief from the daily grind of handling reports and signing forms. When Adolf was alive he had envied the position of the leader of all the Reich, but now that he had it? Well he certainly didn't begrudge the authority, but he was not a fan of all the work.\n\nThe lisping voice of a man brought him out of his task. It was Steinhoff. Anyone else and Göring would have thrown them out, but if the head of his Luftwaffe wanted a meeting, then he could overlook the interruption.\n\nGöring gave one more look over of the baton before addressing the waiting general, "Yes, Herr Steinhoff? What brings you to my office this fine day? Does the Luftwaffe need more funding again? I told you, you don't need to come to me for anything else. All you have to do is take what you want."\n\nSteinhoff shook his head, pushed his sunglasses back up to fully cover his eyes, "Err, no my Führer, it's a matter of foreign affairs actually. Herr Axmann agreed that you would probably want to know that we've reestablished contact with Feldmarschall Milch in Madagaskar." That got Göring's attention.\n\n"Hmmm... I see.

Still, I had the utmost faith in your skills as a commander and was not surprised to hear that you triumphed over the rat Maurice and the upstart natives and Jews.\n\nI understand that you must be very weary of being trapped in such a precarious situation and I am here to offer all the support of the Reich and reestablishing German order in Madagaskar. You and your garrison will be allowed back into the Pakt and granted full reprieve and rest after your great service to the Reich and its people.\n\nPlease accept Erhard, I would be delighted to host you for a time at Carinhall. Of course, should you refuse, I am afraid I cannot guarantee your safety at that point. The Reich requires the island, and it will have it one way or another. I would prefer it to be on friendly terms.\n\nYour old friend,\nHermann Göring, Reichsmarschall and Führer of the Greater German Reich"\n\nMilch read through the letter once more, hardly believing it. He had half convinced himself that he would never be free of this damned island but here it was, a way out at long last. Sure, it had been Göring who had gotten him stuck here in the first place, but at the time that had seemed like a mercy compared to what the racial purists had wanted. Perhaps it was all a lie from his former superior, but dying quickly in Germania was surely better than rotting away in Madagaskar, right?"

Göring was walking through the Reichskanzlei with Milch, introducing him to everyone worth knowing in his regime. His old friend had been quiet for most of the tour, only giving the courtesy-required greetings but nothing more. He looked quite tired and frankly malnourished, although Göring had decided not to bring it up for politeness' sake.\n\nThe reestablishment of Reichskommissariat Madagaskar had not gone entirely as smoothly as he had hoped to be honest. The XVI. Armeekorps had been dispatched to relieve the skeleton garrison and had immediately been set upon by rebel bands still active across the island. At least with the island's airfields retaken they could launch air raids against known hideouts but still, it was shaping up to be a long and difficult slog.\n\nMilch clearly had needed some time to rest, and so Göring had relieved him of his duties and placed his second-in-command Werner Goldberg in charge for the time being. Officially it was only going to be a temporary vacation but seeing Milch in person had made Göring doubt if the man would ever willingly return to the island. Ah well, that was a hassle for another day."

Schörner's words might have been a humorous quip from the mouth of anyone else, but the man did not even crack a smirk. Göring was mentally comparing his top general to an iceberg when Steinhoff jumped into the conversation.\n\n"I'm afraid I must side with Marshal Speidel here; we simply don't have the ability to support ground operations in Madagaskar. The closest airfields are on the African mainland and we haven't had access to those since the South African War. Our forces would be easily pinned down and left to die."\n\nSchörner scowled, and Göring was sure he heard the word "coward" muttered. If anyone else had heard they were keeping it to themselves for the moment.\n\nAll eyes turned to Puttkamer, who had not uttered a word the entire meeting. He did not appreciate the looks, and quickly moved to shift responsibility, "I will support whatever plan the Führer goes with, it's not my place to judge when he is present."\n\nBoth Schörner and Speidel groaned, but the admiral did have a point. None of their arguments with each other mattered so long as Göring had the final say. They didn't need to ask the question obviously in their minds. There was no point in drawing this out any further, he had made his choice anyways."

But his uncle would never part with a symbol of his power and success, not even for all the gold of the Swiss.\n\nApparently Heinrich was not as unreadable as he had hoped, because his uncle seemed to have understood his inner thoughts.\n\n"It is a marvel isn't it? Of course, you could always have one for yourself, if you wanted it."\n\n"Er, but uncle, I'm not a Reichsmarschall."\n\n"Heinrich, you're a Göring, and I take care of my family.

Clicking his heels together with surprising energy he gave the familiar salute that now came with a twist.\n\n"Heil Göring!"\n\nThe old hawk seemed bemused by his subordinate's clear attempts at flattery. "Minister Axmann, it's very good to see you. How has your new position been treating you?"\n\nAxmann cleared his throat, making sure to consider his response lest he upset the most powerful man in Europe. "On the whole I must say I quite enjoy the role. But more than that my Führer, I am eternally grateful and humbled by the trust you have placed in me as your foreign secretary."\n\n"Good, that's very good to hear." Axmann detected the hint of something in his leader's voice, but what it was eluded him. Some new plans no doubt, but Göring was hardly capable of keeping secrets for long. As if he had heard his minister's innermost thoughts, Göring's next remarks revealed what had been on his mind.\n\n"You know Artur, I have been working on a new project with Herr Mockel at HJ headquarters. A fine organization indeed, but then again I hardly need to tell you that of all people." Axmann chuckled politely, wondering where this was headed.\n\n"Well anyhow," Göring picked up his place again, "the HJ was all well in good but it was made to serve Adolf you understand. Well, Adolf is gone and I am now the leader of the Reich. Do you understand?"\n\nAxmann realized at once what he meant and nodded vigorously. Göring's smile broadened, "Excellent! I have all the papers and orders prepared but I would not dream of having the dedication ceremony for my Göringügend with anyone but yourself Artur. Why, you would be in charge of it were you not already engaged but no matter! I offer to you the role of Reichsführer-Göringjügend. A ceremonial title but incredibly prestigious.

A few empty seats away sat Speidel, who at least lacked his rival's unnerving countenance. Still, even if he wasn't as utterly humorless as the butcher, he didn't seem all that particularly happy either.\n\nBut so what? They weren't the Führer, they weren't in charge, and they weren't being promoted. Let them sulk, Göring thought to himself as he watched his uncle ascend to the dais where he had presided as president under the late Hitler. He would show them that he too could lead armies across Europe and beyond. What could they do but sit and watch. Sure, they might play tough and kings of the hill but at the end of the day it was his uncle whose word was law of the land and it was Heinrich who could sway his uncle.\n\nHe tried not to let his smile show as his uncle invited him to stand beside him, to bask in the glory of the occasion as the assembled delegates of the party cheered and cheered. He couldn't be sure that he had been successful, but it hardly mattered.

While most of the army's upper echelons are divided bitterly between rival cliques, most notably those of Schörner and Speidel, the "New Guard" as they have been nicknamed are much less factional. That is not to say they are apolitical, but it cannot be denied that most of the newcomers have chosen not to favor any one side too heavily.\n\nWhile this has been a blow to the clique leaders, always in need of more allies, it is hopefully a sign that the age of militarists leveraging immense political power may be coming to an end. At least, the Führer hopes that this is the case. In the new guard, perhaps there would be a respite from the demons that plague his dreams."

This would be the shortest distance that our forces would need to cross, giving us the best chance at succeeding against the US Navy. However such a landing would lead to our main forces pushing through difficult terrain in Florida and it taking some time before we capture meaningful territory.\n\nAnother proposal which has fewer supporters is that a daring invasion be made in Connecticut, with the aim of launching a blitzkrieg down to capture New York and then cutting off Boston in the north. Organized from Greenland and Iceland, this would get us into the meat of the US faster, but would undoubtedly be more difficult both on the ground and on the ocean.

However, despite the constant flow of gifts into Theoderichshafen, barely any information has come back out.

As he spoke, marines in plain-clothes took up key positions around the city and dockyards: by noon the civilian governor had resigned, citing 'personal disagreements' in a brief and likely coerced resignation.\n\nClaiming he'd wished to stay neutral in the conflict, Dönitz lamented that the intrigues in Germania had finally pushed him into the only faction he felt to be the true, legal government of Germany: the conservatives of Martin Bormann.\n\nNo doubt as surprised at this victory as their rivals are crestfallen, several key Bormanite commanders have publicly accepted Dönitz' support, claiming that only a war hero as true and pure as Karl Dönitz could have seen through the thick smoke of our 'degenerate propaganda' and into the incontrovertible will of Adolf Hitler. This is a devastating blow to our cause - defections in the navy had already begun, and, most worryingly there are fears that the undecided naval commanders we've spent the last few weeks wooing may now rally to Dönitz's, and by extension Bormann's, banner."

To take this equipment to the front lines, just barely performing this important mission before the fuel ran out. Finally, the brave young Joseph would be a hero.\n\nJoseph pictured the Führer, smiling and shaking his hand. A golden medal rested on the imaginary Joseph's chest, as reporters flashed their cameras and asked probing questions about the two.

Hopefully, thought Göring, his heart will win out over his brain.\n\nSimilarly, much of the Speidelite faction seemed happy enough to gain more control over research efforts, but Speidel seemed to be suspicious of such a blatant move to placate the military. Göring had to give credit where credit was due- Speidel was no slouch when it came to brains, and he could tell that Göring was not showing his full hand.\n\nIn any case, both branches had been quite evenly split on their support or opposition to the GRWI.

We would like to point out that our Research and Development Department is one of the best in all of Germany, and does not need additional oversight from the civilian government. Despite Herr Osenberg's arguments, we do not believe that we need to give up our Research and Development Department for increased efficiency when it is already such an efficient and organized part of the Heer. As such, we are afraid that we must decline your request to us to transfer our research department to you. I would personally like to point out that-\n\nGöring snorted and slid the paper to the side. The Heers research department, efficient and organized. What a joke. Göring knew that was a lie, Schörner knew that was a lie, but apparently the rest of the Heer's heads did not. Whatever Schörner had said to get his point across, it clearly had worked on those fools. This was no fatal blow- Göring had the time, patience, and money to get what he wished for, even through somewhat extralegal measures, but it would certainly put a dent in military research. The Führer sighed before turning to the next letter, hoping it would be more positive than the last."

I would personally like to caution you on-\n\nGöring tossed the letter to the side in triumph. He didn't need to read the rest- undoubtedly a tirade from Schörner himself, angry that Göring had outmaneuvered him and not the other way around.

There is also some consternation at your true reasons for this change- some of our admirals seem to believe this is but an attempt to placate the military. Despite Herr Osenberg's arguments to the contrary, we in the High Command of the Kriegsmarine have decided to decline your request unless Admiral Horst von Schroeter is allowed to oversee all naval research, on the basis that this maneuver seems to bring no tangible benefit and would only cost more to us than benefit-\n\nGöring sighed again as he threw the second letter to the side. Speidel's clique had seen through the disguise, at least partially. Without the Kriegsmarine on board, Göring's opportunities to play the militarists would be limited. A temporary setback, for sure- Admiral Schroeter is no political mastermind, and can easily be subverted- but one that was frustrating and would slow the plan's progress, nonetheless.

Scientists, generals, and bureaucrats, all packed around the table, all listening to Osenberg's words. He smiled as the applause died down. Finally, his dream for the Reich's science was coming together. "I'd like you all to give a similar welcome to my co-chair and colleague, Generalleutnant Otto Remer." Remer stood to a similar level of applause, though it was clearly concentrated more on the general's side of the table. Osenberg smiled, but one could tell it was a bit forced if they looked hard enough- Remer was Schörner's way of keeping his thumb on research, and was certainly going to be a pain to deal with. Nothing is perfect, Osenberg thought.\n\nWhen Remer's applause died down, Osenberg began to speak. "Our first topic will be on the subject of the standard infantry rifle. This is less on the quality of our current rifle and more on our quantity of them. Many of our frontline soldiers are still equipped with older models of rifle- I've even heard reports that some are carrying G43's. This is unacceptable, but the question is how we go about fixing it. My suggestion is that we transfer guns from the garrisons to make up the deficit, build some new ones, and replace the oldest guns with newer models to make up the gap. It won't fully solve our issues, but it will be economically sound. All in favor?"\n\nMumbling and debate rumbled across the table. Osenberg watched- he never expected such a suggestion to be a unanimous agreement- but he let out a small sigh when Remer got to his feet.\n\n"I must respectfully disagree, Herr Osenberg." Remer said with a grin. "We can't let our armies, the prides of the Reich, be equipped with suboptimal equipment any longer, in my opinion. We must be better armed than our opponents, shouldn't we? I propose that we devote as many resources as possible to rearming our soldiers with the best the Reich has, no matter the cost. No soldier should die because he must carry a bolt-action into battle!"\n\nMore applause.

Their eyes did not meet his, instead glued to the blueprint laid out on the table, tracing the lines and numbers that made up the tank. Osenberg's eyes shot to the name- the Liger.\n\n"In the opinion of our scientists, this is the ideal tank, my Führer. Brilliant agility, great speed, and the firepower to destroy anything the Americans and Japanese can muster. If the project goes ahead, I can guarantee that this will only bolster our armies." The scientist stuttered. Göring did not address these remarks, instead turning to Osenberg, who had still not moved.\n\n"Herr Osenberg, what do you make of this design?" Göring asked.\n\n"It's terrible." Osenberg grunted.\n\n"What about it?" Göring replied.\n\n"Shit, Hermann, look at the fucking thing. Two guns? The terrible armor? The weight? It's as big as a than a Tiger and half as useful. There's nothing good in it."\n\nThe scientist began to defend himself, but Göring cut him off with a wave of his hand. "No, no, Werner, I don't think you see the potential here. It's a blueprint- a prototype, isn't it?" Göring kept going before the man could answer. "Sure, there are flaws, but I see a lot of potential in this. Can you imagine the American reaction to getting run over by twin-gunned heavy tanks at 70 kilometers an hour?" He turned to the engineer, addressing him directly for the first time this meeting. "Tell your men to get to work on this Liger. I'm confident in your success.

When Osenberg gestured for him to set the papers down, he unceremoniously dropped them onto his desk. Werner sighed and ran his hand through his hair- he could swear it was already thinning even faster from all this. "Is there a problem?" He asked.\n\n"Our efforts to improve upon the original Liger design have hit a small snag. We've improved upon the engine- it's got more power, more speed, and can push the tank along at a quicker pace."\n\n"So what's the catch?" Osenberg asked. He had a feeling he could already guess, but he wanted to hear it from the man himself.\n\n"To produce this new engine, we'll need more time and more money. If you refuse, we'll do what we can to streamline the production of the old engine, but the speed of the tank may be a bit. . .less."\n\nOsenberg sighed again. He could already see it now- the Liger, an expensive money sink, a complete waste of time, and he'd catch all the blame for it. No matter that he was against the project from the start- Göring sure as hell wouldn't take the fall for him, friendly as the two were. Of course, perhaps the fundamental issues of the Liger could be fixed- or at least mitigated- with enough money and development. Who knows, perhaps it could become something workable. Asking for more time and more money would be a pain, but if it saved the project, maybe it was worth it.\n\nOsenberg turned back to the man, his mind made up.

With this new armor, we believe that many of your concerns will be alleviated."The engineer spoke in a calm, rehearsed manner. Osenberg couldn't tell if he had been practicing his spiel or if he just always sounded like that. Engineers do tend to sound a bit robotic, he thought.\n\n"And let me guess." Osenberg slid further back into his chair. "It will cost money and time to actually make this new armor, and I'll need to go beg the Führer for a few more Reichsmarks?"\n\nThe engineer stammered, his flow interrupted. "Uh, yes, something like that. If you don't give us the funding, we'll do what we can with what we have, but the armor-"\n\n"The armor might be less functional, yes, yes, I can guess that."

He spat venom at the engineer, whose eyes were now as wide as dinner plates.\n\n"Well, the guns are functional enough as is-" the engineer stuttered, not used to seeing the normally placid Osenberg this angry.\n\n"Then what are you doing here?!" Osenberg roared. He crumpled the report and threw it at the engineer, watching as it harmlessly flew over the man's head.\n\n"What I wanted to say, Herr Osenberg, is that the guns are unable to penetrate the heaviest tanks that our enemies wield. If we were to upgrade them, they would be a match for anything the Americans or Japanese have." The engineer spoke rapidly, trying to defuse the situation. It worked- Osenberg took a deep breath and sat back down.\n\n"Ah, sorry about all that. Got a little carried away. Anyway, you want more funding for new guns?" Osenberg said, his voice a little strained.\n\n"Yes, Herr Osenberg. Of course, we can use the old ones- they function well enough, and it wouldn't cost any money or time to keep them- but these new guns could help push the Liger into greatness."\n\nOsenberg held in his laugh- he already had lost his temper once, now was not the time to make himself seem like a lunatic.

His gaze lingered on the guns the longest, as if he could already imagine the cannons obliterating American tanks. The three men crewing the prototype watched closely as the Führer continued his loop around the tank, taking in every last bit of it. Finally, he motioned to his aides, and the party of officials departed for a nearby hill, from which they would observe the tests.\n\nIn a moment, the tank revved its engine and sped down the course. Göring watched intensely, gazing through the pair of binoculars he had been provided with. Occasionally, he'd make a side comment to one of the engineers, praising the speed of the tank or commenting on its majestic appearance. However, as the test went on, the praise began to fade.\n\nThe Liger, despite its beginning appearance, seemed to struggle as the test continued. The tank was only able to complete its shooting at a pace that barely trailed the Leopard, despite the twin guns' supposed strength. The engine, which once launched the Liger around the trials in a flash, began to pour black smoke. In a final coup de grâce, the Liger turned to fire upon its final targets, only for the first gun to be blown out of its mounting, flipping backward and tearing through the roof of the tank before slamming to a halt in the soft mud. The ensuing explosion obliterated the crew cabin and all the unlucky men inside.\n\nThe lead engineer instinctively looked over for the Führer's reaction. Göring's eyes, now ice cold, seemed to look straight through the man. Without a word, he and his entourage departed, leaving the engineers to pick up the pieces of their project, both figuratively and literally."

The tank is terrible."\n\n"I saw, Werner, but now isn't the time to lay blame. We need solutions and we need them fast." Hermann responded. His voice was calmer than Osenberg thought it would be. His tone only frustrated Osenberg more- did he not understand what this meant?\n\n"Easy for you to say! This is my ass we're talking about here, Hermann!" Osenberg finished off his drink in one large swig. Hermann said nothing, instead staring off into space. For a moment, Osenberg thought he might have died then and there. After an uncomfortable pause, Hermann's gaze turned to Osenberg, and he began to speak.\n\n"Look, Werner. This whole tank was built off Schörner and Remer's idea-" Osenberg scoffed. Of course Hermann would blame someone else for this. Göring's eyes steeled, and Osenberg shut himself up. "Now, listen to me. We show the Liger off to the public in a parade soon. We get Schörner and Remer to give speeches- we tie them to the project. Then, when it comes out the Liger is a mess, we point to them- they had the idea, they wanted the tank. They look like fools, we get out unscathed, everyone wins. Is that alright?"\n\nThere was another silence. Osenberg hid his surprise under a layer of discontent- he didn't think Göring had it in him to think that quickly. "Yes. Yes, I can work with that. But you better remember this when they come up with another genius idea, Hermann. I'll see you soon."

His seat, stationed just to the right of the podium, gave him a stellar view of the Feldmarschall as he began. Outwardly, he kept his smile up as he pretended to listen to Schörner's words. Inwardly, however, his mind was shot through and through with panic.\n\nThe plan that he and Göring had hammered out seemed to be going accordingly so far, but so many things could go wrong. If Schörner found out, the result could be catastrophic. If the plan was leaked, it would prove a massive embarrassment to Göring's administration. Even if the plan went correctly, what if Schörner and Remer managed to pass the blame themselves? It would eventually find its way back to the GRWI, if not Osenberg himself, and then he would have another mess to deal with. Besides, how much had keeping the Liger's poor performance secret from the military already cost the Reich? Bribing that many people paid a hefty price, and there was no guarantee that one hadn't snitched.\n\nOsenberg realized that the people around his chair were now looking at him, and he snapped out of his thoughts. The sound of applause and Schörner's voice mixed together, and Osenberg looked to see Schörner pointing to him- complimenting his work, he assumed. He quickly brought back his smile and waved to Schörner. The two made eye contact, and for a moment, Osenberg thought he saw something more than just a standard complementary glance in the Feldmarschall's eyes.

I simply see potential in it. You know as well as I that these drugs worked wonders on our soldiers-" Göring began, his voice remaining steady. Osenberg cut him off forcefully, raising his voice.\n\n"Giving a couple soldiers injections of drugs and pouring drugs into the water supply are completely different things, Hermann!

"You don't understand, Werner. This is a military idea. Now, we could use it to help pacify the eastern RK's, as is theorized, but we could also use this in military areas- urban, industrial areas, perhaps- to help with productivity, maybe get the army to help with that. Of course, if this happened to leak to the press, it would be a total disaster for Schörner and his men, and we should take every step we can to prevent that.

At first, the rumor died out in the chain, and got no further than a small circle of skeptical friends.\n\nAnd then it cropped up in a different unit, and then another, and then another. Soon enough, these circles began to run into each other, and the theories only grew wilder from there as each realized that, no, they weren't alone. The whispers tore through divisions like wildfire, the theories as to what the drugs were doing growing more and more outlandish by the day. Suddenly, it was thought that Göring was trying to poison his enemies, that Osenberg was setting up for a coup, that Schörner was planning an execution of those who disliked him, that the Jews had infiltrated the highest ranks of the Reich and were planning a mass mind control campaign to destroy Nazism. All of these theories ran almost purely on conjecture and hypothesis, but that was all it took to buffett the conspiracy to even higher levels.\n\nWhen the first reports of the controversy hit Göring's desk, it was already far too late to stop the rumors. Nothing he could say would end the spiraling theories- if anything, they would only make them worse. Worst of all, Schörner undoubtedly had gotten wind of this as well, and had certainly made a plan to blow it all up in the Führer's face.

It is unknown what the overall strategic goals of the mission was, in regards to the plans of the Partisans. It has been suggested that it was some variant of a suicide mission, where a commando unit was to disable or damage the safety system in order to cause a chain reaction within the power plant. This would cause a type of reaction that would expel enormous amounts of radioactive energy into the atmosphere, leaving the surrounding area virtually uninhabitable. In the worst case scenario, these irradiated particles could reach Germania, in less than three months.\n\nThe more likely scenario is that the commando units were simply trying to disable the Power Plant as a whole, to cripple the energy supply of the Reichskommissariat. Whatever the case, the workers of the power plant managed to activate the safety systems, before a critical error could occur. The partisan group did not manage to defeat the reinforcements to the Plant's security, however they could not be captured for interrogation. The current casualty count is six partisan commandos, three security units and fourteen workers. No men from the reinforcements were hurt in the fighting.\n\nWorkers of the Power Plant have reported that the safety systems did not perform to their recommended timescale, and were significantly behind the expected time schedule. Workers have previously  complained of the outdated equipment to their superiors, however nothing was done. One junior worker even reported witnessing 'bits of graphene' across the outside, after the incident (referring to the graphene rods that control the reaction of energy). A thorough investigation was conducted, but no fragments of the rods were located. The junior worker has been taken to the infirmary, to be psychologically evaluated.\n\nHEIL GORING."

Fearmongering about "dangerous experiments," "wastes of money," and "danger to civilians." Rubbish, all of it, he was certain. \n\nHowever, the problem was that the institution's own failings had certainly not helped its image, and it would be effectively impossible to sustain with any kind of public support. Göring knew a losing battle when he saw one, and while he could keep the institution running, it would frankly not be worth it at this stage, and he had enough enemies without antagonizing the public further. \n\nUnfortunately, the institution would need to be dissolved. It was the best solution, one which would make him seem like he was receptive to the public, salvage what personnel, equipment, and funding remained, and...figure something else out.

He had been afraid that something like this was going to come one day, but hadn't expected it to be like this. \n\nSeveral of the heads of the army had penned a joint letter demanding that he dissolve or terminate the Großdeutscher Reichsrat für Wissenschaftliche Innovation immediately. In the letter they cited a number of dangerous, useless, or inefficient operations and projects were being carried out, and were unwilling to invest their time, resources, and men into an institution they saw as fundamentally useless. \n\nIt was concluded that if he did not adhere to their demands, they would resign publicly. The last part was made explicitly clear. \n\nOne that put him in somewhat of a bind. \n\nShutting down the institution would placate them, but he disliked ceding to them so easily. On the other hand...he could not really afford to lose ranking officers. Confidence would be eroded in him, and there was no scenario that this would not reflect badly on him. If the institution had produced some groundbreaking successes, he could point to them, but they had not. \n\nAt the same time, it was their primary mechanic of researching wunderwaffe, and if it was dissolved, there would be nothing ready to replace it.

Though a menagerie of language and grammar, they all expressed similar ideas-- the new generation of nuclear plants were safe, efficient, and expertly run.\n\nIt was unsurprising that Das Reich would report favorably on this new initiative - Göring would have had the editor shot and the reporters conscripted if they hadn't - but Das Reich was no longer good enough for much of the young, educated, liberal (Göring shuddered at the word) population. Through means unknown to him, the New York Times was the paper of choice for university students across the Reich, and seeing their precious judeo-bolshevik rag report favorably on one of the government's key new projects has convinced many of them that, yes, perhaps the Führer didn't just fall into his position by blind luck.\n\nIt was a shame that an American publication held this much sway over the German people-- the idea that public opinion (and thus Göring himself) would be beholden to a newspaper from New York City of all places disgusted Göring. The only way it could be worse is if Pravda replaced Völkischer Beobachter. Even still, he couldn't be too angry at the Times.

The fact of the matter is that the scientists in Vienna are just the same as the scientists in Albuquerque-- they're mousey-faced geeks who compensate for a lifetime of bullying by obscuring their work behind terms that you have to pay MIT to learn. This is why I have always argued that Americans must come together and deport all of our geeks, eggheads, scientists, nerds, and savants to the heart of fascist Europe where they may be more at home with their anti-democratic ways.n\nThis may be unfair to the scientists however. After touring the German nuclear power facilities, I am of the opinion that perhaps nuclear power is best kept to the hobbyists in the first place. The heartless fascists uncovered and confiscated my stash of freedom, liberty, and psychoactive substances at the border, and thus I was woefully sober as we were marched through the newest and most cutting-edge power plants the Germans had. The concrete, recently and improperly set, already was webbed by cracks. Nearly every control room had visibly exposed and arcing wiring.

Nearly every single publication that published a piece after visiting the new plants said the same things. "Unsafe". "Ecological damage". "Severe risk". "Meltdown".

It was only thanks to a few of the workers who'd actually stayed that the reactor hadn't overheated and potentially melted down. A disaster had been averted, but the fallout was very real. \n\nThe chaos, the shoddy facility, the rebellious workers, and culmination in the evacuation had killed any opportunity to calm the fears workers, soldiers, and civilians had of nuclear power.\n\nAfterwards, he'd ordered an explanation for what had happened. The aides had been reluctant to share, and now he knew why, with the context before him. He was partially amazed that there hadn't been other incidents before now. All of the scientists and staff had been complaining of low wages, bad equipment, and the reactor itself being poorly funded, to the point where the people at the facility wanted no part in the stunt. \n\nThey would be dealt with, of course, but Göring could not help but think he had a very particular problem on his hands.

While such an victory cannot be compared with those great victories we achieved before, the first victory against the western powers after the civil war has still made people passionate about what we're going to achieve in the future. Retired old put on their old medals, and tells stories about their performance in the past; younglings are gathering in the conscription stations, wishing to win their own glory in such an unstable but exciting age. The Reich is now a sea of joy, and all doubts about our newly secured government have disappeared in the dust.\n\nHowever, there are still some troubling consequences coming alongside the good ones. Those militarists, who didn't like us from the beginning, has gained more popularity and prestige by this victory. They openly declared that the Reich need directly take out her enemies, so that we can become the ruler of the world through blood and fire. Though for now the situation is still under our control, we still need keep a close eye over those detestable and ignorant beasts."

His face was a dusky red, bordering on an unhealthy purple as every vein in his forehead protruded grotesquely. It was, however, the man's eyes that most stood out to witnesses. They were orbs, cracked with deep red lines and filled with an unnatural fire, some kind of primordial fury that threatened to burn the man who bore them inside out. Hüttig was not facing his approaching demise with anything close to dignity, but perhaps that was only fair.\n\nHe had been pulled after all, half conscious, from a makeshift brig in one of the Reich's ships that had fled the lost continent Africa. The continent that had been lost by him, or so the Reich had claimed, thus explaining his treatment. Still, if they had hoped to pacify the former colonial governor, they had made a massive mistake. The confinement had only given the man more time to reflect inward into his own dark, distrubed mind. For the days and nights he had spent at sea, only eating the meager rations his former allies had allowed him, he drifted further and further into a black abyss of madness. Every layer of mental safeguard, every justification for serving the Reich, every ideal he had devoted his brutish life to, each was stripped away in painful turn.\n\nAnd so at last when he found himself once more under the white hot light of the yellow sun, it was as a malignant husk of his former self. Capable only of hatred for his betrayers and the degenerates he imagined were surrounding him even now, coherent conversation was nearly impossible. Only the rantings and ravings of a man who had stared deep into the abyss, and had seen the abyss stare back."

It was not one of those marvelous and expensive machines the Luftwaffe had been toying with nor was it even as sleek as any of the private crafts the corporate big-wigs were so fond of. No, this was an older, but also far more durable model that had been built for use in the African Reichskommissars. This was the personal vehicle of Siegfried Müller.\n\nThe craft's landing was... not graceful by any stretch, bumping twice and skidding half a foot. Göring fleetingly wondered if the pilot was drunk. He hoped the former Reichskommissar was unharmed. Still, he reminded himself, if the man could survive the South African War and a run from the OFN for the past several months, a little jostling wouldn't be the end of him. He was brought out from his thoughts by the sound of the 330 Puma's cockpit door opening. From the pilot's seat hopped a man in the dress of a common mercenary, a Sturmgewehr 45 slung over one shoulder; it was Siegfried Müller himself! Only moments before the Führer had been annoyed by the mediocre landing, but that was all forgotten now. The Führer gave a non-formal salute that Müller did not even bother returning, but Göring didn't seem to mind at all.\n\n"Herr Müller, it is so good to finally see you in person again! I had no idea you had taught yourself to fly helicopters during your time in Africa. It was most impressive to watch you in the sky if I may say."\n\nMüller flashed the smile that had won him adoring fans all across the Reich, "Why thank you my Führer. Yes, I did pick up some skills in my time, mostly for the purpose of getting to hunting spots you see, but I am thrilled to have impressed the great Reichsmarschall himself."\n\n"Hunting, yes I did know you were quite an exceptional marksman. We ought to hunt together at Schorfheide. You will come to Carinhall and stay a while to rest won't you?"\n\n"If it's you asking me then I would be delighted sir.""

Siegfried Müller in Zentralafrika would no doubt be able to regale the leader of the Reich with tales of exotic hunts and daring mercenary adventures. Schenck's shared experience in the sky with Göring will surely make for many enjoyable evenings spent in nostalgia. Hans Hüttig of Ostafrika may not be much of a conversationalist or host, but he did do the most to achieve this latest victory for the German people and deserves proper congratulations.

The Führer reflected upon the fact that his host, who had been quite sullen and quiet up until this point, had almost seemed to come back alive when the topic of flying was mentioned. Göring had never considered himself a clairvoyant in matters of the heart, but even he was adept enough to recognize that the man was clearly more at home amongst the clouds than in an office. Perhaps, the Führer thought inwardly, he could have been such a man if things had gone differently.\n\n"So I've been told you were born here in Südwestafrika under the old Imperial colony?"\n\n"Yes my Führer, in Windhoek."\n\n"I see, I see. Did you know that my late father was the first colonial commissioner here? I suppose we both have our connections to one another, both in the lands we are tied to and the professions we have chosen."\n\n"You are no doubt right my Führer, but I must confess I believe I share nothing of your ability to lead others, much less a nation."\n\n"Perhaps," Göring mused, clearly appreciating the flattery, "but we cannot all be Führer material can we? We all must have our part to play in the hierarchy of life just and just as there is an apex predator in every food chain, I was simply destined to serve the German people as their leader." Schenck said nothing to the self-adulation billowing forth from his leader's mouth in a cloak of faux-modesty.\n\n"Er, my Führer," Schecnk seemed somewhat reluctant to speak, "perhaps some time soon we could discuss a possible change in my position? I must admit that I do not truly feel up to this most important of tasks any longer..."\n\nGöring nodded, but his attention was fixed on the trays of food being brought in by the native servants."

Yes, he was in charge of the Imperial colony of Südwestafrika and much like you he had the burden of bringing civilization to this poor excuse for a continent."\n\nNothing. Not even an acknowledgement that he had heard Göring speak. If the man had not been responsible for the recent victory in the war the Führer would seriously consider having him removed and sent to wallow behind a desk deep in the Wolfsschanze. So far, Göring thought, the only thing that had made this visit even semi-bearable was the excellent cognac that Hüttig had provided. It was frankly astonishing to the former Reichsmarschall that a man with such an unpleasantly austere personality would keep such a collection. He made a mental note to carry off as much as he could upon his return to Germania.\n\nJust as the Führer was beginning to lose all hope of ever getting his "companion" to engage in any sort of discussion, the Ostafrikan Reichskommissar seemed to burst into a frenzy of animated movement and speech like a jack-in-the-box springing out.\n\n"My Führer! My Führer it is good to finally be able to talk to you in person!" Göring was about to return the compliment but Hüttig did not let up, "We must talk about the others... I have very important information regarding them... very important information!" His words came in staccato bursts like the fire from a Sturmgewehr. Göring was completely taken aback.\n\n"Herr Hüttig, please, settle down. If you have something so serious to discuss, I am sure we can talk it over at some other time in a more official capacity."\n\nThe words seemed to snap Hüttig back to reality, or so Göring believed when the man stopped his infernal shouting. As the Führer handed his host a glass of the cognac and began to attempt to entertain him with old war stories, he did not notice the dark, almost glassy look that had now settled on the disturbed zealot. He similarly failed to notice the twitching of the man's eyes, or the curling of the man's fists."

While the two bon-vivants were carousing, General Wilhelm von Thoma took the chance to converse with his former superior, the now retired Generalfeldmarschall Rommel.\n\n"You know," von Thoma offered, his voice noticeably charged with emotion, "I never forgot what you taught us in North Africa sir, and I never let my men forget it either."\n\nThe words of praise clearly affected the old warrior. "Herr Thoma, it means more to me than you could guess to hear that I had some value to the future soldiers of my Fatherland. It brings me some comfort in my twilight years."\n\n"Herr Rommel!

Inspect the tanks again? No, he had done that too many times since the Civil War had ended and it was getting stale. Head to the opera? He liked that one but Schörner would be too furious to make it worth it. Design a new wing for Carinhall? Now that sounded enjoyable but what if...?\n\nHe sprang from his seat in a flash of inspiration and snatched up one of the many phones for the numerous important connections he had to call into on a daily basis. This particular phone was marked 'OKW Headquarters'.\n\n"Yes this is Führer Göring. Yes, yes, Sieg Heil. Is Rommel still there? Good, good, put him on quick."\n\nQuiet blanketed the room for a few minutes while the heavyset dictator waited with barely contained excitement. Then, a new voice came through the other end of the line.\n\n"My Führer," Rommel's voice was still professional as ever, even in retirement, "how can I be of assistance to you?"\n\nGöring's face pulled into an almost impish grin, "Herr Rommel, pack your things, I'm going on a tour of our African lands and I want you to join me."\n\n"I - I suppose I couldn't refuse such a request from my Führer, now could I?"\n\nGöring's mask of geniality collapsed for a moment.

Into this frenzy of action and inaction stepped Johannes Steinhoff, who had hurried from the Reichsluftfahrtministerium as fast as his staff car would carry him. Moving to the center of activity, occasionally giving a hurried "Heil Göring!" to a passing officer, Steinhoff advanced to where he knew the Führer would be.\n\nHe found him, his face a dark red, in a state more furious and terrible than he had observed since the close of the Civil War. He was on the phone, and he was shouting, almost screaming down the line.\n\n"Tell Puttkamer I want a cordon established around their ports by the end of the week! Nothing gets in and nothing comes out without our approval and knowledge, do you understand me?" Without waiting for a reply, the dictator slammed the receiver down, hanging up.\n\nSteinhoff adjusted his sunglasses back to position nervously, "So, I take it that the rumors are true then?"\n\nGöring almost snarled at his air chief, "They are! That fucking bastard Hüttig has betrayed us! He has killed Schenck and has driven Müller underground. That's not what's important right now though Johannes. What's important is that we destroy him, we turn his ridiculous fucking 'Reichsstaat' into dust and ashes. That's where you'll come in - I want bombers over Quelimane today!"\n\nSteinhoff said nothing, just blinked. His words carefully chosen, the former pilot answered, "My Führer, if we really have lost the continent then it is logistically impossible for us to reach any targets within Hüttig's territory."\n\nGöring's face went purple, and for a moment Steinhoff had the half-humorous, half-grotesque mental image of the man popping like a balloon. Göring did not pop however, but after a tense moment he did seem to almost deflate back into his chair from which he had half-risen.\n\n"Fine then," he whispered sullenly, but as Steinhoff turned to leave he spoke up, "but tell Marshall Schörner to see me at once.

I wish that I could stand before you today and say that the war ended with all of our noble aims fulfilled.\n\nI cannot say that however, because that would be false, and I have vowed to never speak an untrue word to the German people so long as I remain Führer. It is true, our battle has ended indecisively, without clear victory for our people. However, this does not mean we can simply give up now! Quite the opposite, we must redouble our efforts to the spread and preservation of our people and National Socialism across the world. Our outposts in Africa have been battered, but they still remain intact, our dreams shall not die until the last Aryan has perished from the earth.\n\nRest assured that those who have failed the Reich will be given their just deserts, and let this serve as an example to all those who serve the German nation: this is what happens when you fail! Even in failure however, we gain strength, just as we gained inner strength from the travesty of Versailles to embrace the truth of National Socialism, it is my belief that this momentary setback will be looked back upon in similar fashion. When future historians chronicle us, they will write of this as the moment a reborn German people, still scarred from the flames of civil strife, recommitted themselves to taking their rightful place.

Unfortunately, the unit proved unsuccessful at sinking any of the transports and inflicting more than superficial casualties while losing several men in the process. It seems that a major, fatal blow to the effort was struck when the Werewolf unit leader Hauptmann Friedrich von Tannenburg was killed in a skirmish at the Dam.\n\nUpon reaching the coast the small river transports headed north and we may yet catch them at one of the docks as they search for ocean-going vessels but I fear they have eluded us.

The Belgian industrialists in the area, however, would prove much more tractable as an ally. Hüttig's authoritarian, strictly national style of rule had chafed them and hurt their bottom line. It would be a strong alliance, if von Hassel could bring them to his side."

Göring would have appreciated something he could point at in the meantime, to prove that Hüttig had not been permitted to carve out his little domain without resistance from Germania. He supposed he could endure the utter humiliation of it for a few months more, if it meant that the empire Hüttig had stolen was razed entirely to the ground.\n\nHis thoughts gathered, Göring listened as Gehlen spoke. "A group of men loyal to Germania, led by a particular Herr von Hassel, will work to subvert Hüttig at every moment." Gehlen did not smile, but the Führer imagined he was very satisfied with his own work. "Eventually, they will make a move against the government. Either we will have Africa in our hands once more, or the resulting chaos will lead to a total collapse of Hüttig's regime in the area."\n\nGöring was keen enough to pick up the implication that it would likely be the latter of the two possibilities. "Let him keep the ruins of his hell-state, if he's so damn attached to it." The Führer declared, though he was not so happy about the potential loss as he attempted to seem. "You've done well, Herr Gehlen." He waved his hand, silently dismissing the Abwehr man as if he were a trained hound. He had much to think about."

goering.430.d:0 "It was another mandatory meeting of the war cabinet, which to Gerhard Barkhorn meant trouble. And yet, even as he had the thought while following General Steinhoff into the conference room, he could not help but notice that Führer Göring seemed surprisingly placid. Good spirited, even. Something was certainly up, although the Luftwaffe staff officer couldn't begin to fathom what would cause the Führer to appear as such. It hadn't even been a few months since the last meeting when he had been red with rage, his eyes burning with venom for the traitor Hüttig and the loss of Africa.\n\nIt was only when Gerhard moved in close enough to see the map halfway between the Führer and Feldmarschall Schörner that he understood what was going on. It was a battleplan map, with lines crossing every which way but all ending in bloody arrows stabbing into the heart of the continent. Gerhard suppressed a gasp. This was impossible, insanity. He wished he had possessed his superior's dark sunglasses to hide the doubt in his eyes, but with any luck he would just be ignored as usual as long as he kept silent.\n\nSteinhoff unfortunately had no such luxury. The air chief meandered over to his leader and with his usual slight rasp questioned, "My Führer, do my eyes deceive me, or is that a plan of attack against the so called Reichsstaat sitting on the table? I was under the impression that we had decided against any such effort."\n\nHe spoke to the Führer, but Gerhard could just make out the shadows of his lidless eyes turn towards the OKW chief.\n\n"That's just the thing Steinhoff!" Göring almost bellowed, exuberant, "After discussing the matter with Schörner, I have decided to put any attempts at reclamation on hold, for now. In return, the Generalfeldmarcshall has so considerately drawn up these plans for me. Aren't they grand?"\n\nGerhard attempted to feign disinterest, but he had the uncomfortable feeling that Remer could sense the deception from across the table. He shivered as he turned his gaze back from the butcher's protege and to his superior.\n\n"I... yes I agree my Führer, these plans are quite exceptional""

Göring wanted to yell at someone, but the only people he could blame for this disappointing display were down in Africa. This would've been the perfect opportunity to showcase a renewed German might following the pain of the Bürgerkrieg, and that idiot had Hüttig botched it. He had thrown thousands of German soldiers, precious resources in their own right, into the meat grinder. And this was what he had to show for it? Unacceptable! Göring paced around his office.\n\nThis was an international relations disaster. Thanks to Hüttig, would the OFN simply strike at the weakened Reich? Would it extend its Judeo-Bolshevik tendrils further into Europe? Africa had been lost; what was next: Italy? Sweden? Finland? His mind raced with nightmares of a surrounded Reich unable to reassert its power.\n\nWith slow, deliberate breaths, the Führer calmed himself. This was a temporary setback, nothing more. The OFN had won the battle, but not the Cold War. This was all explainable by the Reich's still fragile position thanks to the traitors, no need to overthink it. Just like any setback in his career, the Führer reassured himself, he would come back and on top at that."

And yet, for all that, his eyes still burned with the same disturbing light that they always had.\n\n"What was that?" came from one of the prisoner's guards, his rifle to the ground but always angled so that in an instant he could put a round into Hüttig if needed.\n\n"I said," Hüttig began, his voice icy with contempt, "that you are all degenerates. Every last one of you who would treat a man who has devoted his entire life to the cause of the Aryan people like this."\n\nThe guard looked inquiringly at Göring, asking for permission to simply end the madman's ravings. The Führer shook his head, "Let him say what he wants Franz. It's not like he can do anything anyways." A slight smile crept across the Führer's face as he spoke the last line, sure of his absolute power.\n\nHüttig continued to rant as he was led towards the courtyard's wall, "You are the traitors here, not me. I served the Reich, the ideals of National Socialism, what do you serve Herr Göring? Whatever the generals want? Whatever fills your pockets? How can the Aryan people have fallen so low as to follow such scum? The Reich does not deserve to survive with you degenerates at its head!"\n\nGoring grunted, the man simply would not shut up. "Franz," he motioned lazily to the guard, "finish this embarrassment off please."\n\nWith an enthusiastic nod, Franz raised his rifle and fired off a quick series of shots. Hüttig groaned and started to sway, but managed to right himself from falling. The holes in his chest pulsed angry and red, fatal shots, but the man's sheer rage pushed him on.\n\n"Incompetent degenerates! The Reich is doomed to die with you and your masters in the Wehrmacht at the helm! It deserves whatever end you bring it, I'd rather see it burn then with such degeneracy in control. I would've...

Not bad all things considered.\n\nThe news had come in the middle of the night when all but the most insomniac of the soldiers had long since passed out. A little spook from the Abwehr Kolonialbüro.

goering.707.t:0 "What Do Wolves Dream Of?"
goering.707.desc:0 "Göring sat alone in his chambers, with but a tumbler of whiskey in his hand, silently contemplating the latest fiasco which Iberia once again revealed to the world. With the Italians out of Algeria and the government in Algiers at tatters, the Caudillos thought they could finallyclaim this land as theirs- and who better to govern this new fiefdom than their long-time lackey, Yves-Guerin Seraç, as leader of a French-minority military government? Göring smirked- this arrangement could go wrong in so many ways. And go wrong it did: Seraç didn't even bother to get comfortable in his new post before he denounced his overlords and established the State of Algeria as an independent entity on world politics. The idiots- they really need to learn to pick their subordinates.\n\nNot that he was in too enviable a position either. His own "subordinates" were already encircling the young warlord like hawks, fighting amongst themselves as to how to deal with him. Some believed that Seraç's clique would prove a valuable lapdog for the Reich, safeguarding the region's oil deposits and providing fresh untermenschen to throw in the front lines that would otherwise have been pure blooded Germans; others yet are disgusted at the idea of once again allowing collaborators to partake in Germany's moment of greatness, and insist on crushing all resistance and setting a new Reichskommissariat that will ensure all affairs are handled by proper German hands.\n\nSo Göring was left with a decision to make; a luxury he didn't get too often anymore. Personally he had way more important things to tend to right now than another shithole in Africa- and in a way, that made the prospect of just collaborating with Seraç and letting him do the dirty work very tempting. And if the man has an ounce of self preservation he'll surely cooperate. On the other hand, self preservation didn't stop him from betraying the very people who put him in power. And no matter how disillusioned he had grown through the decades, even old Hermann had to admit that asking an arrogant asshole in Africa for help like they needed him was just plain wrong."

goering.708.desc:0 "The General will see you now, gentlemen, and apologises for your wait" announced a sturdy male voice that made Valentin Scheller raise his head from his copy of Die Beobachter, where his attention had been drawn to for the last three hours. The voice belonged to a uniformed Pied-Noir, who then proceeded to bow and show the way to him and the disgruntled ministers besides him. But Scheller was calm; he knew by now why people like Seraç had to show they were "too busy" for people like him.\n\nIndeed, as they stepped into the grandiosely decorated room, one would think they were in a palace; just like one would think, as they looked towards the Lion of Algeria, Yves-Guerin Seraç, sitting in his designer suit with the air of a man who had won every battle of his life, warmly welcoming them with a sardonic smile, that this man had no doubts about this day. A lot of work and money was poured into this illusion, surely. But these men hadn't come all the way from Germania to stare at gold candelabras and fine paintings; and as the pleasantries faded away and the negotiations began, it soon became very clear to all involved that Seraç's deck was empty.\n\n...which makes it not only desirable, but integral, that the Ministry of Economy shall retain complete autonomy to dictate and direct its own budget, with the Dinar as its default currency, which shall remain pegged to the French Franc and not to the Reichsmark" was how the longly worded but in reality fairly short list of Algerian demands concluded, which included the retention of the established French-styled government and all French ministers within it, the sovereignty of the armed forces, with German garrisons in Algeria supplementing instead of guiding the Algerian command, as well as direct state control of at least 50% of the exploration perimeters of the national oil fields. The carefully crafted and practiced document that constituted another piece to Seraç's masterful bluff, described in the most intrepid light what his true goal -or pledge- was: to please be left alone and retain whatever authority he could over his small fiefdom. All this futile act confirmed Scheller's suspicion: Seraç had no way out, and had nothing to resort to but to beg. With the tiniest and rarest of smiles creeping up on his lips, he opened his own briefcase with calm, precise movements."

"I understand that the remaining deposits might fall short of your 50% goal, Herr Seraç, but Herr Göring is willing to offer subsidies upwards of 10 million Reichsmarks per year as reparation. As for the lands occupied by foreign investors, we are willing to aid you in their immediate eviction. After all, the Einheitspakt should offer you much greater return in investment regarding all your exports." What he failed to mention was that the trading policies of the Einheitspakt towards Reichsprotektorats mandated that any and all exports shall be controlled through Germania, from where they will be sold as German goods.\n\nAnd that's only a small footnote in the book of things that were not explicitly mentioned in the contracts. Like how the part about national-controlled oil fields did not mention endless nights of drinking with the President and major shareholders of Sonatrach, who had agreed to set the groundwork for a merger with IG Farben. Or how the part autonomy of the government did not mention the heavy handed deals that were scheduled after their arrival of German observers, or the unexpected... empty seats that would arise during their stay. Or how the support role of the German garrisons did not mention the astronomical bribes to several high-ranking officers. For Kirchmann and his business associates, this was what one would call a hostile takeover; for Seraç, this was the loss of whatever control he managed over his state, and the transformation of his perceived role as ruthless dictator into that of a powerless scapegoat for the colony's misfortunes.\n\n"I believe that will be all for now, Monsieur Seraç" interceded Scheller, standing up from the table as Kirchmann was packing his papers. "It is getting late. In the following week you will have plentiful opportunities to converse with us on the details." He gave a tiny smirk, a rare occurence. "I believe you will see that everything should be very advantageous for you and your administration. Bon nuit, gentlemen."

Algeria will indeed be recognised as a German Reichsprotektorat, and cede almost the entirety of the oil fields demanded during the conference - with the rest of them, officially under state ownership, following them within the next month.\n\nOur envoys are currently sailing back home, while a wave of permanent representatives is being scheduled to replace them soon.

But someone had to keep the state afloat- and there was no other man he'd trust that on but himself.\n\nHis train of thought was interrupted by the sudden sound of an incoming telegram- directly from his Chief of Navy.

And it better be about this sack of shit that calls himself an ad-" "Excuse me General but, you might want to check the TV. Now." The TV?

"Those bastards think they can just barge in as if this is their damn playground! How has the General allowed this?"

How could he, after all the pain and sacrifice he had gone through, have surrounded himself with such useless people? People that could only inform him of an impending invasion AS IT WAS ANNOUNCED IN THE NEWS! Or was it not stupidity? Was his staff intentionally withholding this information from him until it could no longer be held secret? He could not know- he had lost too many friends to tell anymore- and did not care.

Within the following week they will be followed by the appropriate Garrisons and border divisions, three military engineer detachments, equipment and representatives from IG Farben, among others.\n\nWhile the scheduled reinforcement of the colony is fairly heavier than typical of other RKs, especially ones of this size, and their absence from the Fatherland will be noticeable for some time, this will hopefully allow Nordafrika to serve as the coordinative and administrative center for all our future ambitions in Egypt and the Maghreb."

He looked forward again, waiting briefly for a response that never came. "Neither did he; his demeanor was too calm." He puffed a ring of smoke. "It was Seraç himself who ordered this. He wanted you to be violent and ruthless. He wants to show he fears no one.

The disadvantage is they have little interest in mastering their craft - only avoiding beatings. This reliance on slaves is beginning to show - the quality of German goods has experienced a noticeable drop, and while unemployment and early retirement remains high there is an increasing drought of skilled workers.\n\nThis quality drop is a symptom of a problem that we are unable to directly address. We must patch as best we can, forcing a diversification of the economy by subsidising technical educations and discouraging our workers from resting on their laurels.

They are vital in procuring the Reich's resources, and use this leverage to acquire shares in mines and steel mills and positions on the boards of every company that goes east to the Reichskommissariats. These same companies extend down and down, allowed their influence to extend throughout the economic sphere.\n\nWhile the Wehrmacht is ostensibly loyal, their influence should be checked. Granting loans to smaller businesses outside the military's influence would give them a fighting chance against the oligopolies that dominate our industry. Alternatively we could grant the same contracts that the Heer and Kriegsmarine throw about so carelessly to a foreign company, and attempt to starve the Wehrmacht of their child-businesses."

The Führer, Hermann Göring, and his right-hand man, Feldmarschall Ferdinand Schörner, look intently at the maps spread in front of them, though only one of them actually understands what they mean: despite his experience as a pilot ace, Hermann Göring has never been a general, and rather than maps, he prefers paintings, which he deems a much better use of canvas.\n\n"Gentlemen" begins the Feldmarschall, rousing the crowd from their ruminations.\n"The Reich still stands, but our empire has fallen apart.

Maybe it was not where he wanted to be, but right now, everyone answered to him. And that was all he wanted. Now, some bloated, jumped-up warlord who calls himself the Führer of all Germans wanted to take this power that he had worked so hard for, and all that Daleuge could do was watch. Though no weakness would be shown to his men, he knew what the outcome of this war would be. At least he had the opportunity to make life as miserable for that gorged fool as he possibly could. He looked back at the papers in front of him, then tentatively he pulled a map from the drawer next to his desk. For a second, he hesitated, questioning his own authority; but he reassured himself that he was the only authority in Böhmen-Mähren. Daleuge began to draw a battle plan.\n\nAs the SS regiments marched out of Prag, they did so with discipline, but without spirit.

The Mähren-based resistance is led by one Rudolf Toussaint; a veteran of the First Great War who has since dutifully served his country during the Second World War, and this loyalty was unfazed by the succession of Führer Göring. He is the perfect candidate to lead our operations on the inside.\n\n"Herr Schörner. It is good to hear from you". Toussaint grimaced his peers in the room upon hearing the gravelly Bavarian accent on the other end of the line. Unsurprisingly. he found himself on the receiving end of a barrage of orders which his assistant hastily wrote down, whilst Toussaint could do nothing but agree. Eventually Schörner was done, and the call ended, without the resistance giving a single point of note back to the commander.\n\nThe room awoke in a calm, but passionate, debate. Toussaint's old guard emphasised caution in the face of Germany and wanted to toe Schörner's line, whilst the newer officers promoted after the fall of the garrison wanted to try and make contact with a general who would actually listen to the resistance. Nothing came of the debate. Everyone stuck to their positions, and Toussaint eventually dismissed the entire room. No good would ever come of divisions.\n\nQuietly sitting at his desk, Toussaint looked over his plans, then over Schörner's plans. Not much use in his own plans now.

Besides each of them, a small drawer, presumably the only possessions the SS soldiers owned. A swastika on one end of the room, and the Black Sun on the other. No windows. There had to be something of worth in here, since there was nothing in the rest of the village; surely the SS couldn't have sent it all back to Prag?\n\nFor the next hour, he searched every drawer and found little. A few pictures; siblings? Loved ones? Could the SS even feel love anymore? He found one pocket watch, presumably an heirloom. Might as well keep that one, he supposed. There were a few books, mostly filled with the ravings of that lunatic Himmler. Rudolf put them to one side, so it would be easier to burn them later. These men lived with next to nothing; no cards, no memories of home, just their uniforms and their hatred.

But the reality is that he rules Ostland, and instead of simply agitating for a war, he has completely shocked our diplomats by coming cap in hand to the Reich offering to be our vassal.\n\nThe nerve! An untermenschen under the Reich? That would be a stain that cannot be wiped from our nation! The reaction from the hardcore militarists are one and the same. We cannot trust him, and the only way we should be even considering dealing with Vituska is with a bullet! With the new focus of the Reich being conquest to make us great again, it seems as though this would be in keeping with the policy we promised Germany.\n\nBut another band of less hardline officers has suggested the unthinkable; accept the proposal, undermine Vituska's authority, then eventually integrate Ostland again. While this seems a wild breach of the militarist belief that won us the civil war, there is an element of reason in their plan; we can spare Ostland from a second wave of destruction that would no doubt leave the colony far behind the rest of the Reich in industrial strength and Germanisation.\n\nThe final decision rests on the shoulders of the Führer.

But Herr Schörner is beginning to believe he holds the keys to the Reich. If we were to reduce his officers to mere diplomats to Vituska's regime, it would reduce his power in the metropole and send a message that the Führer still holds the reins. Schörner himself does not seem shaken by rumours of this proposal; perhaps he has finally learned his place!\n\nAlternatively, we could simply send neutral officers to take part in the exchange. Vituska would possibly hand over better information if this were the case, as it certainly helps to negotiate with men who aren't openly calling for your blood; but Vituska is utterly unpredictable, so who can say what he truly wants.

If we sent his desperately under equipped forces weapons then we may be able to achieve true lasting stability in Ostland and root out the partisans once and for all.\n\nOf course, it isn't that simple. If we were to send Vituska as many arms as we can spare, his forces would likely be more effective and could even defend themselves against threats from Moskowien; it would also help build Vituska's trust for us. However, this is putting our arms in the hands of a dangerously unpredictable man, and perhaps it would be best if we only send enough arms to put down the partisan menace, not enough to defy our will."

While Germany had been busy tearing itself apart, the jackals in the SS had leapt onto the similarly stricken corpse of Ostland, and now a black tumor grew on the side of the Reich. Invasion was a no brainer- it had always been the plan to integrate Ostland into the Reich one day- but it pained Göring to need to waste German lives on a territory that was once an easy landgrab. He needed to make it easier- the less lives lost, the better.\n\nAn idea came to mind. Certainly not all Germans in Ostland were fans of Jeckeln's maniacal regime. After all, were they not just fighting him? They may not have much in common, but something that could generally unite Germans of all walks of life was their distaste for the SS. Certainly, Göring and his men could find some veterans brave enough to rally themselves for the return of order and the purge of the madness that the SS brought.\n\nThe idea crystallized in his head, and Göring smiled. Remer and his men would infiltrate the Ostland border, searching for militarist contacts. Once there, they would form their own units, ready to sew chaos behind enemy lines. These infiltrations would not only make the war a thousand times more manageable, but would shorten it drastically. Besides, Göring reasoned, even if the plan did not fully pan out, it would rid him of Remer for at least some time."

The last vestiges of the SS must be wiped out without a trace to deprive them of the opportunity to spread their poison. On the orders of the Führer, the triumphant Wehrmacht troops will march throughout Ostland and initiate a series of mass arrests. This procedure will naturally be indiscriminate, even messy, but we cannot afford to take any risks. All SS members and sympathizers will be detained and dealt with in due course."

Should he ever turn against us, there is no doubt we can put him down. Along with undermining Vituska, the exchange has also been successful in cutting down militarist power, with Schörner's hardline influence notably diminished.\n\nDespite the success of our plan in undermining them both, neither Schörner nor Vituska seem to see through our plot. In fact, they are both enthusiastic about continuing the exchange, and Vituska has sent a request to keep Schörner's officers remaining in Ostland longer to supervise a new training program. This arrangement benefits us the most; but the wholehearted embracing of our plan by the people it should impact the worst has aroused suspicion amongst a few in the government."

The trade has also been mutually beneficial on the surface, with each of our armies now better prepared to fight together against outside threats.\n\nOur officers are returning home right now. Despite the fact we appeased them by sending neutral officers, Schörner's militarists are protesting the recall and stating that they could've retrieved more vital information and made Vituska even more vulnerable. It seems no matter what we do, they're going to protest. Perhaps it is time to stop feeding Schörner's beast, and instead start defying it?"

Whatever we thought, we were wrong. Today Schörner's officers launched a coup in Ostland, attempting to seize power from Vituska and hand it over to the hardline militarists.\n\nPerhaps it was fortunate for us that Vituska was already a few steps ahead. He was able to put down the coup with remarkable efficiency, and now all the officers we sent are dead. Of course, Schörner quickly went to cover up the coup failure, so we have little information about the planning of the coup; but this has weakened him severely, despite also showing the flaws in the intelligence of the central government."

A perfunctory arm raise, and the feldmarschall is already in front of the desk.\n\n"Mein Führer!" he begins with his usual boisterous countenance, "the time has come to reclaim our rightful lands to the South! The traitors in the Reichsprotektorat have refused to help us in our struggle against the other pretenders, and they must be punished, just like the Czechs in 1938: if you take a look at this map you'll-"\n\n"No, Feldmarschall", Göring's tone is sharp, interrupting Schörner's tirade. As the general, now visibly incensed at being contradicted by his superior, opens his mouth to reply, the Führer closes the discussion: "Von Krosigk has always been a loyal servant of the Reich. By proclaiming his neutrality he has saved the Bohemian industrial core from being captured by the degenerate SS, don't you agree?"\n\n"Yes, but-"\n\n"Then, if you understand, there is no need for an invasion. I won't send Aryans to die fighting other Aryans while we can achieve the same result in a civilized manner. I'll personally conduct the talks at Carinhall, and we'll see whether von Krosigk is loyal or not.

Seating side by side, Hermann Göring and Ludwig von Krosig, Reichsprotektor of Bohemia, enjoy a fine meal prepared by the Führer's personal chef, the ample time between the servings allowing for some reminiscing.\n\n"How long has it been ever since we had dinner together, Ludwig?" Göring's voice was almost nostalgic, "you were still Finanzminister, weren't you?"\n\n"It must have been at least ten years, before I became Reichsprotektor" von Krosigk had the same tinge in his tone, thinking about different times, when political enemies were still that, and didn't try to have you shot for treason, or begin a civil war.\n\n"Indeed! How much time has passed, my friend... things have been tough, though I'm sure you too had your own enemies to fight in Bohemia... pesky SS, always trying to snivel their way in. You have been extremely competent, just as you have always been, a great resource for our even greater Reich!"\n\nHis guest nods politely, part sincere and part calculating, as he has learned to be. He knows, however, that reminiscing isn't the only reason for his presence at Carinhall, and he isn't disappointed.\n\n"This is why, despite Schörner's opinions, I've decided that you'll be appointed gauleiter when Bohemia is reintegrated into the Vaterland"\n\nOf course. That was the reason for the invitation: von Krosigk has known, ever since the end of the civil war, that the Bohemian industries would be highly coveted by the resurgent Reich. While being spared the occupation is indeed a relief, he knows that it's not a benefit, but rather a policy on his loyalty. Happy or not, he knows he has no choice.""

Martisen's hopes of convincing Göring of leaving Denmark independent were dashed.\n\n"Ah, Schörner. This uh... fellow was just explaining why we shouldn't annex Denmark." The ever tightening knot in Martinsen's stomach forced an involuntary gasp out of his lungs.\n\n"The hell? What are you thinking? You know that you can handle Denmark better if you have the full power of the Reich on your side. Or is this a personal thing of influence? You know that exploiting the Reich for your own personal gain is degenerate, right?" Schörner said. The knot in Martinsen's stomach released. It was a relief to know that, without a doubt, you were completely fucked over either way. "How about this; we give you the OKW garrison there and annex it. Sound good?"\n\n"Yes, of course."

Eventually Speidel spoke up.\n\n"Well, Göring may not, but I will. That's why you wanted me here, isn't it?

You have read the terms of the arrangement I sent to you on our re-involvement in the Reich I trust?"\n\nGöring was taken aback somewhat, he had expected a few more pleasantries to be exchanged before they got down to business.

He forced his good humor to come back and tried to regain some control of the conversation, "Of course, of course Herr Pleiger, you'll have total control of operations at your discretion I promise. Please, why don't we discuss the finer details over dinner at Carinhall? I promise the food is quite excellent."\n\n"My deepest apologies but I must decline my Führer, the work around here never ceases and if we are to begin producing enough for your army once again we will need to expand even further. Please sir, I would ask that you leave me now."\n\n"Oh, I see Herr Pleiger. I will leave if it disrupts your efforts." Göring had the horrible feeling that for all that he had, he was powerless here. What choice did he have though? Pleiger controlled the oil, and if he didn't cooperate, he'd have to risk destroying the machinery that made it possible.

Schörner had ears everywhere however, as the Gemeiner would no doubt learn in the coming days.\n\nAs they turned the corner, the Gemeiner was grumbling over the uselessness of patrolling Riga.

What followed the conquest of Belarus was the emergence of a distinctly colonial German culture: fierce, strong and hardy. The Ost-Germans have brought the virility of the Aryan race to this backwater, sowing the fertile seeds of the German people in the rich farmlands and verdant forests. With plenty of colonists present, the racially acceptable natives being rapidly assimilated and the remainder pushed to the fringes of society, the Führer has seen fit to formally integrate these parts of Ostland into the Reich.

Accordingly, the aggressive pursuit of Germanization can slow down to a more measured pace. The Führer's reasoning is simple: with their will to fight repeatedly broken and a strong German presence established, the natives pose no threat at this point and their assimilation or displacement is so certain that the Reich can finally afford to ease up, redirecting resources to more pressing matters. The integration of the remaining parts of Ostland, be they majority-German or native, is to commence immediately and without hesitation. Our race will win out in these areas soon enough."

He shifted his gaze to the floor, awaiting Göring's violent castigation, but it never came.\n\nInstead, he heard the Führer's leather-backed chair creak as its occupant leaned back and tapped an idle finger on the desk.

Should the Führer deign to bring up anything from his wine cellar, he could choose from thousands of bottles of the rarest vintages that Europe has to offer.\n\nToday, however, the Führer is taking less personal economic matters into consideration. Reichskommissariat Ostland has returned to the fold and its economy is recovering well, but many prominent Ostlanders have been petitioning Berlin for additional investment. A dose of cash delivered on the Führer's order would certainly help create more jobs and send a positive message to private investors, but there is another matter to consider: the loyalty of Drechsler's officer corps. A fair number have been brought on-side while nobody was watching following the civil war, but perhaps it's worth attempting to secure the loyalty of a few more. Many of them are contemptuous of Drechsler, a known coward.

Though the media has no inkling of where the money came from, the people who leaked it - namely, a number of Schörner's underlings who apparently caught wind of the Führer's attempts to buy Drechsler's men - the Wehrmacht undoubtedly does. Gestapo surveillance personnel have reported that the Reichskommissar and Field Marshal met this morning, likely to discuss a punitive response to Göring's failed attempt at turning their men against them.\n\nGöring's blunder has deeply impacted his standing with his powerful allies. This minor incident might not come to much, but it has revealed the Führer's vulnerability and lack of political acumen. He has no need to fear the possibility of a coup over something so minor as bribery, but now the Wehrmacht will be on full alert for further attempts to corrupt its men."

goering.967.desc:0 "FROM THE OFFICE OF THE FÜHRER, TO ALL LOYAL OFFICERS OF THE REICH:\n\nThe recent military action against the renegades in Reichskommissariat Ostland continues to trouble the morale of the Wehrmacht. This, your Führer is more than aware of. However, he is also certain that anyone reading this memorandum is equally aware of the reasons behind the decision to invade and depose the pretender Reichskommissar. It has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that Otto-Heinrich Drechsler was corrupt and in the employ of the same nefarious forces who reduced Ostland to a state of civil war. The fact that this man was a long-serving member of our great establishment does not excuse his betrayal of the Reich and the German race. Loyalty and trust is measured by one's dedication to the Führer and the willingness to obey unquestioningly. That Drechsler refused the Führer's direct order to stand down from his unlawfully claimed post should be reason enough for all to join in condemnation of his actions and purge his memory from the rolls of the NSDAP.\n\nNonetheless, it is clear that nobody expected treason from such a widely-known and well-respected man - an ex-Gauleiter and veteran of the Sturmabteilung, no less. The Führer recognises the reality of Drechsler's popularity and wishes to ameliorate your concerns by assuring each and every one of you that he acted only out of necessity, not for any petty political gain. The Führer is above such temptations and has only the greater good of the Reich in mind when acting in his capacity as father to the nation. It is his sincerest wish that harmony and concord should reign amongst the armed forces - a wish that we can all work together to fulfil now that the dark days of civil conflict are past.\n\nHeil Göring!"

goering.921.t:0 "The Stahlecker Issue"
goering.921.desc:0 ""You haven't met Stahlecker, have you?" The question was muffled, with Erich, Göring's secretary, rummaging through a filing cabinet for the celebratory brandy. "The man's a dyed-in-the-wool National Socialist, loyal as they come." Göring didn't respond. He simply sat and stared ahead with hands folded, clearly lost in thought and oblivious to the one-sided conversation taking place. "I'm sure you wouldn't get along with him," Erich continued, "But that wouldn't matter. If you told him to jump off a cliff, he'd do it solely out of respect for your office."\n\nAfter a minute more of awkward silence, Erich returned to Göring's desk, grinning and holding up the 25-year-old brandy that the Führer had pocketed during a visit to Paris in 1940. Göring didn't seem to notice, continuing to stare past his secretary even as the bright-eyed young clerk poured out a glass for his boss. "My Führer?" he asked, noticing Göring's blank expression.\n\n"Hmm? Oh, thank you, Erich," Göring muttered, closing his worn fingers around the cool, hard glass. "No... no, I haven't met Stahlecker. He was an SS man during the war, so I never had the pleasure." A twinge of worry shot across his face, and he raised the glass to down his drink in a single go, savouring the memories of less complicated times that it brought up. Minutes passed, during which Erich could only stand in place, awkwardly fiddling with the bottle's cap. "Give me another, boy," he finally grunted. "The Field Marshal is coming to dispense some 'advice' soon. Let's make sure we're properly fortified for it, eh?""

Stahlecker, ever the loyalist, had accepted his offer to negotiate and allow aid into Ostland. The Führer's feelings - and the subsequent celebratory drinking - are mirrored throughout the Reich. The state media, still a muddled mess after the civil war, had been pushing contradictory headlines regarding the Ostland situation for weeks, but by the afternoon of the day in which the Führer put out a statement to the press, every paper, TV news show and radio broadcast delivered the same message: No More Civil War.\n\nHowever, far from the temporary warmth and peace to be found in Carinhall that night, OKW headquarters seethes with treasonous spite. Peace? Peace, with the great Otto-Heinrich Drechsler murdered and Ostland in the feeble grip of a Bormannite? Peace, with a man who would rather laze about and lord over idle subhumans? Peace, with a man who was by all accounts a coward, a traitor and an indolent old conservative?\n\nNot on the Field Marshal's watch."

There would, many realised, be a lot more shouting later in the day if that outburst was any indication.\n\nHours later, Field Marshal Schörner downed the phone, hooked directly to the Chancellery, with a satisfied smile. He had known, of course, about Göring's peaceful overtures towards Stahlecker. For a time, he had been concerned - it was an open secret that Göring had no interest in so-called 'pointless' wars or anything beyond enriching himself and enjoying the perks of his office. This, however, was the first step towards changing that. It would take some time, yes - but if he were to be pulled deep enough into the Field Marshal's machinations, he would soon find himself too bogged down to even think about defying the will of the armed forces again. Then, and only then, would the Reich's invincibility be ensured."

The few brave enough to attempt to eavesdrop in the thirty seconds that the men spent with the Führer heard no exchange of words; no indignant shouts or threats of arrest, nor snide, practiced military snobbery. When the officers left, the only apparent change was the absence of an envelope, stamped with the mark of OKW, that had previously been carried in a worn and scarred hand.\n\nGöring had been expecting such an outrageous move in response to his decision to pursue peace with Stahlecker, however. There had been no exchange of words for precisely that reason; the Panzergrenadiers had their orders, and Göring had been informed of their arrival hours in advance. With all the pieces so clearly laid out, there was no need for words - only a silent understanding.\n\nThe letter was clear in its wording. Cold, uncaring and professional - straight from the desk of Field Marshal Schörner. "Army High Command," it read, "Is deeply concerned by recent decisions made by the Führer. As the unquestionable defenders of the Greater Germanic Reich, we wish to express our hesitance to endorse the Führer's refusal to employ a practical solution to the renegade colony of Ostland. We recommend the immediate issue of an ultimatum demanding total submission and compliance to the self-proclaimed authority therein, under threat of military intervention. We expect that the Führer will wholeheartedly endorse this measure and carry it out post-haste.\n\nSieg heil!"

That such an ardently loyal National Socialist would defy a direct order from the Führer - any Führer - is an unexpected setback, but now a line has been drawn in the sand between the Reich and its rogue colony. Any action taken against Ostland, military or otherwise, will now be legally justified and much more palatable to the Reich's citizens. Now, Göring is under pressure not just from OKW, but from many civilians in his administration and cabinet. A self-proclaimed Reichskommissar has refused his orders and set his men on a belligerent stance against us - how can we possibly react with anything but swift and bloody retribution?\n\nWith rather pointed words, apparently. So claims Göring, at least. Still set on avoiding bloodshed despite Stahlecker's insult, the Führer has expressed his belief that the renegade can be brought to heel. His logic is sound, at least: Stahlecker, as a Bormannite, values Germanic unity above all else. The shedding of Aryan blood is anathema to him and it was a wonder that he even found the willpower to push through the Ostland civil war in the first place. Yet, deep down, he is no true soldier; he lacks a military awareness of war's realities. Demonstrate to him in no uncertain terms what war with the Reich would entail, and he will fold. The Führer has received a certain amount of support for this idea, even from elements of the Wehrmacht, but wonders aloud if it's worth the effort."

Concerns have been expressed by certain ill-educated economists that the demand for Ostland's economy to be placed in the hands of Germania's bureaucrats was a step too far and that it will have disastrous consequences for the colony, but the Führer is happy to be done with the whole messy affair. The Wehrmacht, too, has stated their gratitude to Stahlecker and the Führer for their admirable effort in overcoming ideological differences to ensure a better future for the Reich's favorite colony.\n\nAnd yet, there's a sense that we could have done better."

Even if you had not just lived through one of the most bloody and catastrophic civil wars in the history of Europe, would you be willing to do such a thing? Would you risk spilling the blood of your friends and family members from the Fatherland? Would you truly put your life on the line for a civil servant who has overstepped his legal authority?\n\nThe Führer wishes for peace, but must enforce the unity of the Greater German Reich. All he does, he does in the name of security, peace and brotherhood. If he must unleash the armed forces of the Reich upon Ostland, then he will not hesitate to do so, even if the burden weighs heavily upon his heart. You all know what this entails: the Reich's own weapons will strike you down; its war machines will grind you under its treads; its mighty guns will bring the very sky crashing down upon you.\n\nIf you would stand for anything, stand for peace and unity!

goering.928.t:0 "Trouble on the Border"
goering.928.desc:0 "It would appear that our saber-rattling has had unintended consequences. During breakfast, the Führer was interrupted by the arrival of a report from one of the staging grounds near the border with Ostland. Apparently, an entire Panzer battalion decided to conduct some 'reconnaissance' on their own initiative. They didn't report anything unusual upon returning to base, but one of our infantry patrols reported seeing smoke rising from a Lithuanian village just over the border. Recon aircraft quickly confirmed that the village of approximately 400 civilians had been razed to the ground, with no signs of life remaining besides some wandering cattle. This particular village had not previously been of any interest to us due to its lack of defenses - Schörner claims provocation by partisans and the Ostland garrison, however, stating that his men were defending themselves.\n\nThe Führer is outraged by this impropriety, but that may well have been the intended result. There is little publicly available evidence of our forces' involvement in the attack, so certain elements of the militarist cabinet are urging him to turn the incident into a propaganda offensive to aid a coup against Stahlecker which is currently in the works (which is the first that the Führer has heard of such a thing). The Führer, for his part, would rather just pretend the incident didn't happen at all, to avoid any disruption to his war of words with Stahlecker - he is certain that his plan will still bear fruit.\n\nThe army, however, makes no secret of the fact that they bear responsibility, and is pushing for the Führer to authorize a second raid to undermine Stahlecker further. Why Schörner would advocate for two different solutions at the same time is anyone's guess."

A pair of ME-262s were conducting a standard scouting mission in our airspace near the border when they were attacked and aggressively pursued over the border by the Ostland garrison's own fighters! Our pilots fought bravely and with great skill, but were outnumbered by ten to two. A loss was inevitable, with Lieutenant Wilhelm Kurtz being shot down over hostile territory. Thankfully his wingman made it back to base, but the damage is done. Even as the Luftwaffe mourns this loss, their allies in the Heer are baying for blood, now that there is proof of Stahlecker's hostile intentions.\n\nThe Führer is now under immense pressure to issue the invasion order, as continuing with attempts to intimidate Stahlecker will now infuriate the Luftwaffe as well as the Heer. With anti-Stahlecker sentiment now becoming so much more prolific, can Göring afford to continue dragging his heels?"

Those close to the Führer's office were able to catch enough specific words that by evening, rumors were rife throughout Germania: the Luftwaffe had destroyed one of their own aircraft in a false-flag attack intended to smear Stahlecker. How the Führer learned of the plot is unknown, but the assumption is that Stahlecker himself was involved.\n\nYet there has been no move on the Führer's part, nor a counterattack by the militarists. The officers were permitted to leave the building, thoroughly shaken but unharmed. Whatever they said to the Führer, it was enough to give him momentary pause. Could it be that he has resolved not to take action against the plotters, despite their gross insubordination and betrayal of one of their own? Or is he merely considering the options laid out before him?\n\nThe Führer alone knows the true stakes of his situation. The militarists are dangerous, yes, but their most recent plot may have gone too far even for their ambition. Should action be taken against the plotters using the Abwehr, there are unlikely to be serious consequences, and Stahlecker has proven that he acts in good faith and is deserving of fair treatment. However, the greater plan... Might that be worth all the skullduggery and deception, in the end?"

Stahlecker has promised that mutual recognition of legitimacy is all he ever sought, and that he will serve the Reich "...faithfully, for life, and unto death." For his part, the Führer had this to say:\n\n"We live in trying times. Loyalties are constantly put to the test in unexpected ways, as are one's commitments to one's ideals. The recent disagreements between the Reich and her colony are the result of unfortunate circumstances and the realities of the day. It is tragic that loss of life occurred as a consequence, but with this agreement a great deal more bloodshed has been avoided.

Piles of weapons, vacated bunkers and abandoned motor pools line every highway and no small number of garrison troops have simply vanished into the woods, either heading for home or abandoning their cause altogether. Their fate makes no difference now.\n\nStahlecker and his staff are now heading by plane for Germania, no longer employees of Reichskommissariat Ostland. Indeed, the Reichskommissariat no longer exists as of this moment; now formally dissolved as a separate entity, all Aryan Ostlanders are now full citizens of the Reich and the colony's treasury has been snatched up by the Führer's financiers. A number of economists have expressed concern at this seizure of the colony, claiming that it is 'unprepared for integration'. This is nonsense, of course - the Führer has great expertise in economic matters. There may be some teething issues, true, but give it a few days and the colony will be more prosperous than ever."

After weeks of dragging his heels, Göring has achieved little more than lose the respect of conservatives for treating Stahlecker so harshly and infuriate the Wehrmacht with his preference for words over action. The invasion can no longer be stopped, despite Göring's best efforts. Any order to hold fast would likely fall on deaf ears, as Schörner is past tolerating attempts at 'peace' and 'unity' for the time being.\n\nWar returns to Ostland; it will be swift, brutal and merciless. Anyone who knows the lay of the land and the disposition of the Wehrmacht could accurately predict that tens of thousands are likely to die, innocent or otherwise. Bombs will completely destroy what little civilization remains in Ostland, while rapine, plunder and savagery will be the order of the day, as it was thousands of years ago.

While no doubt amusing to the rank and file, he has a surprising amount of sway; not over Stahlecker, who remains as stoic as ever, but over the people of Ostland. The last thing we want in the event of successful negotiations is for the Ostlanders to rise up against our rule and render the whole peace process completely moot.\n\nThe Abwehr has pointed out that with the chaotic situation in Ostland, it would be child's play to remove this obnoxious individual from the equation. Even better, we have a man in Riga - a survivor of Drechsler's cabinet - who has spent the past few months schmoozing with his former enemies, who are unaware of his past loyalties. By pulling a few strings, passing fistfuls of marks to the right people and disposing of the troublesome individual in question, the Abwehr is confident that we can get our man into Stahlecker's confidence and start chipping away at the resistance from within.\n\n"

Of course, it was apparently too little too late for the Wehrmacht, who have once again called for an invasion of Ostland. They refer to the man's anti-militarist rhetoric as 'subversive, disrespectful and indicative of the general company that Stahlecker keeps'.\n\nThe prospect of invading over insults - especially when the one responsible has been fired! - is obviously ridiculous to any level-headed individual, but the Wehrmacht is rarely a bastion of balanced, rational thought these days.

The same is true for the entirety of Ostland - everywhere, the garrison and Orpo are back on their routine patrols (though with fresh faces among them), farmers tend their crops and factories begin to churn out goods for sale back in the Reich. Even the non-Aryan natives seem mildly appreciative of the situation; they might be on the fringes of society, but at least they aren't being shot at by the SS or murdered by partisans for not being anti-German enough.\n\nIn his office, refurbished with new furniture from Germania befitting his now-official status, Stahlecker allowed himself to recline with a satisfied smile. This is what it was for - all the unpleasant things he did in the SS, the civil war, the tense negotiations with a Führer he had little in common with. This vision of peace and stability, so thoroughly devalued in recent years, made it all worthwhile. Perhaps Göring would drag the Reich through years of war and pointless attempts and conquest, but the Ostland Stahlecker had fought so hard for would endure. Of this, he was certain."

Things escalated substantially this week as he went on a long-winded and exceptionally crass rant while being interviewed by a Swedish journalist, with a number of choice insults, vile epithets and insinuations about the sexual proclivities of the Reich's leadership all being printed word-for-word in the Stockholm evening newspapers. He has apparently escaped any kind of discipline for this.\n\nThe Führer's response to this story was little more than a world-weary sigh. He had expected a phone call from Schörner demanding retribution to avenge the insult, but it was several hours before such a call came through. On the other end of the line was Schörner's aide, who hesitantly stated that the Field Marshal "...favors immediate military action to, uh... to avenge this insult and - what was it, sir? - uh, and the sullying of the image of the Reich's glorious leaders."\n\nEveryone is a little confused at this point.

The van was mostly intact, but several passers-by were hit by flying projectiles and left screaming and writhing on the pavement. Ambulances arrived promptly, but despite the relatively low number of casualties the attack has shaken the people of Riga. At this point, natives and Germans alike yearn for peace - why strike now? Who would wish for more bloodshed at this point?\n\nGöring is concerned that Stahlecker does not have the resources to handle the threat of an active terrorist cell. Allowing him to try and handle it independently might have disastrous consequences for peace, especially if key figures in the Ostdeal become the targets of assassins. To this end, the Führer has attempted to dispatch the Abwehr, only to be rebuffed.

With little more to do, the terrorist was turned over to the Ostland Orpo. The Abwehr wished to simply shoot him out of hand, but records show that he is an Aryan native, entitling him to a proper trial not too dissimilar from those enjoyed by full-blooded German citizens. A minor loss for us, but at least justice will be served.\n\nGöring is happy to have avoided conflict with Stahlecker over this, and the Abwehr is very pleased to have done their job well and without interference from the Ostland authorities, but every successful negotiation sets off another round of grousing from the Wehrmacht.

Beneath the neat spectacles and the stone-faced expression of a model Bormannite, is there some manner of Judeo-Bolshevik devil, seeking to torment and subvert the Reich at every turn? Why string the Führer along? Why make him sit through all these negotiations only to turn around and become a stick-in-the-mud over THIS of all things? Why not just let the people with the best of intentions do their jobs? Wouldn't that be better than just jerking them around and... and...\n\nGöring sighed again, downed the rest of the bottle, and awaited the angry phone call from Schörner."

The steps into the Führer's office were torture, as were the pleasantries before the meeting began. Slowly, however, the sense of dread was replaced with confusion as Hermann continued to dance around the point, asking questions about his combat record, his experience, his education- it began to dawn on Foertsch that this may not be a punishment, but a job interview.\n\n"Well, Foertsch, I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you in here." Göring said, taking a drink from his glass. Foertsch silently nodded. "You know of our recent operation in Slovakia, yes? It's clear to me that the Slovaks are still too untrustworthy to entrust with running their own country. After all, that's what we did for years, and they split from us the first chance they got. I'm planning on setting up a new Reichskommissariat there, and you seem like a good man for the job."\n\nFoertsch sat silently. This was not what he expected.

The question pervaded in Göring's head, rising to the top every time he had a moment of peace, banging around in his mind like a pinball. It made no sense- decades of subservience, quiet obedience, and then suddenly they had jumped ship from Germany as fast as they could. All the way up to the Bürgerkrieg, the few reports that ever came from Slovakia were mundane- peaceful, quiet, boring reports nobody gave much mind to. Why would they?\n\nIt struck Göring like a lightning bolt. The reports were so incredibly wrong because the Slovakians had been hiding their intentions. While they had paid lip service to the Reich, they had been secretly planning their betrayal for years! It all fell into place- the sudden change in heart, the resistance to German control, all of it. As Göring figured it out, the plan began to fall into place.\n\nThe collaborationist government would be restored, as expected, but they would never again get so much autonomy. The Reich had taken its eye off the ball, and Slovakia had exploited it to the fullest. Now, the Reich's eyes would be glued to Slovakia, and the army would be ready to sweep in the instant a single piece of the puzzle tried to fall out of place. This embarrassment would never happen again- not under Göring, not under anyone after Göring, not for a thousand years."

It wasn't like they were any real threat to the Reich, but this festering sore on Germany's underside was taking a hundred German lives a month. What was wrong with the Slovaks? When God made them, clearly he had forgotten to put in the quit.\n\nThere was an easy way to solve this, of course- expanding Orpo operations to the Slovakian region. After all, could local forces be trusted with occupying their own nation? No, such an arrangement was begging for disaster. The Orpo would control Slovakia, and it would learn to be obedient, calm, and placid. Slovakia would learn order. Whether they learned it through gunfire or diplomacy would be up to them."

Then, the German soldiers left, and the people of the city managed to take one final breath before the next wave came.\n\nThe Waffen-HG- the HG standing for Hlinka Garde- was oppressive in its actions, brutal in its punishment. On what seemed like every corner and every square, a German soldier watched over the crowds with rifle in hand. The people quickly learned to fear them, and soon the streets were quiet- no more demonstrations or furious speeches, only the sounds of cars and footsteps, all watched over by the Germans.\n\nThe people hated the Waffen-HG, but what could they do about it? They had been disarmed, destroyed, and overwhelmingly crushed by a monster far, far greater than any of them. Even if, by some miracle, they succeeded in expelling the German beast, they'd just come back with their tanks again, and this time Slovakia would never get another chance.\n\nSo the Slovakian people, by and large, gave up.

He turned towards the car, and for a moment, all four men could see the sudden fear flashing through his eyes as he burst into a run. The driver slammed on the brakes, and the three men leapt out of their seats, chasing him into a dark alley.\n\nAs the man ran for the next road, he realized his mistake- the alley had nowhere to take cover, nothing to hide behind. The point was punctuated with three sharp cracks of gunfire lighting up the walls like a camera flash, and the man collapsed with a thud.

Surely you would know him by reputation, at least; the man is famously infatuated with the subhumans of eastern Europe in a manner that goes beyond mere academic fascination. His loyalty has been suspect for years, but the Gestapo were never able to find conclusive evidence to bring charges of treason against him. It is likely that his significant personal fortune was the means by which he evaded the law - were we to conduct a thorough investigation, we would likely turn up many a Gestapo officer with greasy palms.\n\nMeyer-Landrut is no military man, but his betrayal of Aryan ideals has wooed many Balts and Slavs, who now fight for him along with our traitor kin. More significantly, of course, he represents a serious ideological threat as the last holdout of Speerism. My Führer, it is this agency's concern that as long as this traitor to the Fatherland and National Socialism remains active, the legitimacy of the Reich is threatened. It is Field Marshal Schörner's view that immediate action against this final pocket of resistance within the Reich proper is necessary, before the poison of liberalism finds root within our society again."

Those who survived the war were all too easy to find. Often accompanied by their staff - no doubt indoctrinated into obedience - many were caught and arrested in their own homes or officers, desperately burning one document after another to try and protect themselves.\n\nWith the owners of some of Germany's biggest banks and businesses apprehended, it was a simple matter to rubber-stamp the paperwork necessary to seize their assets and transfer them to the Führer's personal control. The agents who brought in the snakes each received a commendation and a hefty bonus, cut from the wealth of their quarries. Doubtless we shall need such keen minds when the time comes to pursue such foes of the Reich once more.

Shortly after the news broke in the morning papers, the Wehrmacht's press office released a statement confirming that two squads of Pioneers from the 44th Grenadier Division stormed the empty factory at approximately 5:00 AM with orders to carry out the demolition of the entire structure. The factory was, according to 'reliable sources', being used as a hideout for a large SS cell. More importantly, it allegedly produced weapons for the traitors, with the entire workforce being implicated by the Wehrmacht's informants. Accordingly, the Pioneer units placed demolition charges around the factory in the hours before the first workers arrived, only detonating them once a majority of the workforce was confirmed to be on the clock. An attempt to dig for survivors in the rubble was repelled by the timely arrival of a large Feldgendarmerie contingent, who sealed off the site and declared that more Pioneers would soon be arriving to apply further explosives in order to 'collapse any subterranean construction'.\n\n"I don't understand," said a passing civilian when asked for comment. "That place was a brick factory. There aren't even any armaments factories in the whole of Riga. I've worked in both kinds of factories and I can tell you that there's no confusing brick-making equipment for gunsmithing tools."

"Your boy got back to you quickly, didn't he?" Despite their differing cultures, Dietrich and his family had been accepted with relative warmth. So far out from the major centres of civilisation and its tracts of arable land, there had been little objection to a lone colonial family moving into an abandoned woodland home. Someone had to keep the deer in check, after all.\n\n"He did." Dietrich motioned to the blasted tangle of steel and wood half-buried in the mud right in the middle of the road, where there had previously been a minor railway running through the forest. "He couldn't say what it was you wanted me to see, but it certainly speaks for itself."\n\n"Yes. I wondered, given your time in service, if you would know how this happened?" There was a pause as the German scratched at the graying stubble on his chin and went rummaging through memories of 20 years prior. Given the thoroughly wrecked state of the rails and three-foot-deep crater, it could only have been done with military-grade demolition charges.\n\n"Small but strong railbusting charges," he finally said. "Only Pioneer units are equipped with those. The soldiers who passed through yesterday must have been scouting for vulnerable points in the railway like this crossing." With a sigh, he walked over and began picking up bits of planks littering the road. "Come on, Simas. Let's get this as clear as we can so people can bring their trucks through.

Armin shouted, barely able to hear himself over the roaring inferno and the howling midnight wind that carried threatening sparks towards his home. "Stop, dammit!" There was no response. The soldiers continued whatever they were doing - whether they were chatting, laughing at the thought of some farmer's harvest going up in smoke or just silently observing the outcome of their grim objective, he could not tell.\n\nFinally reaching the squad, Armin reached out and grabbed at the sleeve of the closest grenadier, who jerked back and span around, raising his assault rifle. His eyes were shrouded in shadow by the pillar of flame, and its wicked light glimmered on the brass buttons of the other soldiers as they turned to look at Armin. He was panting and exhausted already, the strain of middle age and his recent cold making it difficult to inhale lungfuls of the frigid nighttime air. "What... Christ, what have you done? My entire- I- Why the fuck would you do this?" he screamed.\n\nThe grenadier sergeant raised a hand and snapped his fingers. The rifle pointed at Armin sounded a crack into the night, the 7.92mm round striking him in the heart.

Others who are more moderate than those radicals also believe that a military invasion is necessary to reclaimed our eastern lands and reunite the German nation under the third Reich. War, as usual, is the only option we can take now.\n\nAs our soldiers are preparing for the upcoming military operation, the whole world and especially our former territories in the east are waiting in silence to see what could happen next. But no matter what, the lost children must be brought back to their family, and sometimes a violence way is required. Now, let's hurry up and prepare for what will inevitably come."

And now, the bad news for Moskowien is, we have established contacts with the resistance.\n\n"Hey, you Germans", their answer are simple and plain, "you know, we don't like you and obviously you don't like us as well. So, let's go directly to point. We need guns and other equipment to fight against the government in the Volga State, so if you wish to punish those 'traitors', you'd better agree to our terms.

That's all our demands for you, and we wish to receive your aid as soon as possible.

If we don't punish them for this, soon all Slavs will rise and fight against us.

But soon after the war, the fame of the Wehrmacht slowly withers due to internal corruption, and other nations starts to find their confidence back. Though the Heer has found its strength back after the baptism of fire during the civil war, future invasions could still be more difficult than our expectations if the enemies believe they stand a chance against us.\n\nTherefore, in order to make the Blitz of Romania swift and smooth, military exercises are continued to conduct in these days. Our most advanced equipment as well as military discipline and capacity are shown via newspaper reports and live television to the whole world, especially our people and the Romanians.\n\nWhile our people's faith is strengthened once again, report from our spies says that the Romanian government are in deep pessimism now. The voice of capitulationism is becoming increasingly louder, and some people has advertised that it is hopeless to resist the "German beast" and surrendering is only way for Romania to survive. It seems that there won't be much resistance in the upcoming war."

We have yet to reach them, but they are strong enough that they will pose a threat once fully manned. Currently however, they are vulnerable, with most Swiss forces on the front lines. The newly proposed plan would have us sabotage these forts, rendering them useless before the Swiss have a chance to cower inside them.\n\nA small debate has emerged over how we should sabotage the forts.

The first option would be to force the Swiss POWs to assist us in our war effort against their homeland by dispersing and enrolling them at our various slave labor camps. The second option would be to make an example out of these rats by giving them what they rightfully deserve for defying the fatherland to defend their bankers and fattened businessmen, death.

The easiest choice is to just give them supplies and help them organize a great national uprising once our panzers start to march into the Yugoslavian lands, since it can greatly distract the Yugoslavian armies and make our invasion much easier.

At the end of our meeting, they told us that they had already organized some political dissents and ready to take our orders.\n\nNow, as we've successfully made connection with them, it's time for us to decide which role they will play in our invasion plan. The first choice is to let them organize a national uprising, which will greatly reduce the resistance on the front. However, we can also let them do some underground activities and sabotages.

Though we never considered them to be our real allies, we still provided some assistance to them, hoping to make them trust in us and cause more troubles to the Yugoslavian governments.

But now, all the weapons, ammos and medicine have finally returned to the right hands.\n\nThe materials have been checked and distributed into local garrisons to keep order and maybe even used to kill the remnants of Chetniks themselves.

Indeed, even as the guns began to roar a response to the Finn's attack, the admiral knew it was a doomed effort.

He wasn't allowed to light it, they said- any light could be a possible trigger for a watchful policeman or concerned citizen to investigate.\n\nThe three shadows moving down the street made their own effort to stay out of the light, sneaking close to walls and moving only into the edges of a street lamps glow. Occasionally, they would stop, turning to the wall to paste something onto it. The man in the truck could not read what they were saying, but he knew what it was- poster after poster, detailing the benefits of restoring the German Reichskommissariat.\n\nFinally, the two men returned, their hands empty. As the driver flicked his headlights on and began to drive away, the light flashed off the multitudes of posters plastered on every building. He couldn't help but laugh at the almost comedic sight of it- this would be a hell of a thing to wake up to for the locals. Perhaps they would see the light, perhaps they wouldn't. Either way, one thing is for certain- the people would know that the Germans were coming, and that the hardliners of Norway were ready with open arms for them."

Inside the cabin sat 3 men, hats pulled low and papers in hand. Those papers they jostled and bumped around were detailed and striking, depicting scenes of a benevolent German soldier watching over a group of children, each waving the flag of the Reichskommissarat that was so suddenly taken away. In the back of the truck sat another few hundred of these papers, each ready for distribution across every street and building. The people tomorrow would wake up to a city covered in pro-german propaganda, and they would know that their salvation would be at hand.\n\nOr at least, they would have, had the truck made it to its intended destination.\n\nUnfortunately, the police had been tipped off beforehand of hardliner activity in this particular area, and as such had prepared themselves for it. The truck rounded a corner, only to find its path forward blocked by a squad car. Before it could react, another squad car sped out behind it, blocking its path. Even as the driver cursed his luck, police stormed forward, dragging all three men from the vehicle and slapping cuffs around their wrists. The truck, after being searched, was impounded, and the papers taken and burnt.\n\nThe arrest of the three men was mentioned only in passing in the next day's papers."

In fact, the driver had been explicitly told that this whole affair would be in and out, and yet 20 minutes had passed. As the minutes continued to tick away, the dark worries that the man had suppressed the entire drive north began to gnaw away at his resolve. What if they had been caught? What if the explosives weren't working? What if this had all been a set-up, and at any minute, a hundred police would come barrelling down the road?\n\nLuckily, his friends returned right as his resolve, already weary, began to fail. With empty hands and smiling faces, they ordered a quick exit. The driver, still full of nerves from his near panic attack, was more than happy to oblige.\n\nAs the truck slowed down near an overlook of the complex, one man squeezed hard on the detonator. Almost immediately, a flash cracked across the valley, and a huge building in the center of the factory disintegrated.

Even in his dazed state, he pondered how he had gotten here as he slowly recovered from the hit that had sent both him and the truck flying, flipping over and over into a gorge.\n\nHe supposed it had to have started when he had joined the fascists, way back in the day. The Germans had made it so easy for him to make that choice. Of course, he was younger, and more hot headed than he was now. He had wanted any chance to bail out of the fishing village that his father, his mother, and their fathers and mothers had called home, and when an offer from the local collaborationist regime arrived, sending promises of an apartment in Oslo, a well paying job, and a chance to protect his homeland, how could he refuse? Of course, if he knew where that path would lead him, he never would have taken it.\n\nAnother place he could have changed was when the Nazi's left Norway. In the chaos, nobody would have noticed just another suddenly missing man from the rosters. But he stayed with the division he had based his career around, all the way up to when they needed a driver for a mission in the north, on a promise from the Führer himself. But there was no time left for regrets now.\n\nEven while upside down and with a swollen eye, the driver could make out a small group of partisans carrying away the equipment the Germans had graciously given to them. His eyes wandered over to the partisan crouching next to the truck, rifle in hand and pointed directly at the driver's head.\n\nThere was only enough time for the driver to let out a sigh of regret before the crack of a gunshot cut the air, and regrets that the driver had held for years disappeared in a flash."

To be sure, the English had been beaten even worse than during the first Sealion operation, but now they had dispensed with the need for a civilian puppet. Even the former collaborators would be unwilling to serve their masters now. And what of it? The thought asserted itself in his mind. They had proven themselves as little better than subhumans, unwilling to bend to those who were their superiors in every way.\n\nThe conquest of England had heralded the end of the continental war in the Second World War, the high watermark of German military triumph.

As a Moskowien field marshal, he might not have inhabited the most glorious of the Reich's offices, but it was a place of belonging all the same.

Of course this would only prune the official structures that Schörner had built up, but it was far better than simply leaving things the way they were.

Recovered assets and conglomerated capital from the excursions of War Plan A buttressed the budget, but the increases in Heer expenses alone swallowed any windfall gained from the seized banks. He fears to even wonder what may happen if the windfalls stop.\n\nIn another room the colonels and other staff officers eye the projection on the wall. The general presents to them the summarized findings and assessments for War Plan B, the culling of those petty fiefdoms on the Pakt's doorstep. The former Triumvirate represents the greatest industrial and military rival to Germany on the continent, yet their weakness is known. Iberia is unstable and Turkey is weak; though these nations are mountainous they will fold in the face of the energized Wehrmacht. Italy, however, is different. Modern equipment, defensive positioning, and large resources mean ultimate victory will be slow, and therefore strangling their operational capacity in a national siege will bring victory in time. All the while, the Slavic Bolsheviks are rising in the east; to ensure a successful invasion of the Mediterranean, the Eastern Front will be - must be - secured once and for all."

Too small for a mass action, too porous for surgical bombings, it has been decided at a general staff meeting that the solution shall instead be to commence a military raid in the territory so as to neutralize enemy fortifications and combatants in the region.\n\nAs the orders trickled down the chain of command, hundreds of armored personnel carriers roared to life, thousands of soldiers loaded their rifles, and untold tons of explosive ordnance were armed for the coming days. As the forces make ready, the officers commit to memory their objectives; drive an iron wedge between the core of Onega and its outlying territories in Finland and, once the first phase is completed, storm the encircled outlying regions before an effective counter-offensive can be organized. Helicopter reconnaissance elements have already identified priority targets during the blitz - barracks and makeshift forts - and close air support has been tasked with the destruction of these secondary elements to expedite the skirmish.\n\nThe rousing of the goliath is not something that goes unnoticed, and even with the element of surprise it is reported that our flyovers have set the enemy on edge. Even now mechanized columns race ready at the border, prepared to charge the enemy in pursuit of bloodshed; if they did not not know we were coming, they will shortly.\n\nIt will be something they will not soon forget."

Hundreds of bodies coat the cold ground, and as their empty eyes stare into the smoking horizon the only sight that looks back at them are the shocked survivors, themselves being rounded up by Heer reinforcements.\n\nWith the first strategic objective secured, we stand able to make ready for the total seizure of Onega. Enemy battalions at the periphery were able to withdraw beyond our operational range and regroup with what remains of their armed forces, though it will not help them. Now that they well and truly know that we are coming for them, they have no defense outside the calculus of war. Our armored units surging into position for the second wave, Luftwaffe aircraft circling on station, and more reinforcements on the way ensure that they will not be able to resist our next operation even if they had not taken the losses they were just subjected to.\n\nRegardless, orders are coming in now.

Debriefing - or interrogation - of surviving infantrymen describes a military folly of a magnitude painful to even consider. Enemy grenadiers and saboteurs disabled or destroyed dozens of vehicles, to say nothing of the now-smoking corpses inside of them, and were obscured from retaliatory airstrikes by trees and terrain. Further, past Luftwaffe bombings destroyed all roads and ingresses to vital areas, and intelligence did not consider this when creating the tactical plans causing entire armored columns to become stuck and having to abandon their vehicles for fear of enemy capture. The vehicles could not be secured by their leaving crews, so one officer ordered a bombing run on the valley to deny their use to the Russians, but poor communication resulted in targeting a separate - occupied - convoy instead.\n\nThe shame of being defeated at the hands of an untrained, ill-equipped, degenerate enemy in a backwater unlisted on maps is too much to bear. Those survivors not shell-shocked stand in formation afraid to speak, officers pull at their collars as sweat beads on their brow, and the commanding officer turns a shade of red his subordinates had never seen before."

As many troops as we could spare were thrown into defensive positions on the perimeter, and as the sun rose low in the east the battle began in earnest. They expected a force a quarter of our size, and our immediate counter-offensive hamstrung them only a few kilometers deep into our territory. Once met in earnest, the fighting was beyond brutal. Even with our knowledge of the enemy and the terrain they outgunned us in almost every skirmish, and many were lost before our soldiers could even reach engagement distance. But that gap was closed, and then the false world of the Nazi crumbled to dust in their minds as they were fought, broken, and routed one by one. This is an indescribable victory. The goliath of the Reich spans a continent, and yet it was defeated here. The army of the Germans slaughters all in its path, and yet it was slain by Russians. The weight of the Swastika crushes all beneath it, and yet, somehow, we still stand.

Already, generals and brave patriots demand that we mobilize and take the fight to the Germans before they've taken all that we have.

As they outgun us several times over, however, others argue to make ready our defense for when they inevitably come to us.

The general staff is now in agreement. The Nazi war machine has arrived at our doorstep, and it hungrily eyes our possessions.\n\nOur generals argue that, without a doubt, the Germans aim to sever our control of our Northern territories and our White Sea ports. However, our options are painfully limited. Many among our military's finest minds argue that we must prepare to defend against a swift and brutal German onslaught, and that our best odds are to fortify to the greatest of our ability given our limited time so that the Germans are not permitted to cross the Onega river under any circumstances.\n\nOne other proposal remains, however. To prepare a hasty attack upon the flank of the amassing German forces.

Ersatzheer reserve forces have been called up and mobilized to swiftly respond to this mounting threat, however it is uncertain when these forces will be prepared for combat.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the order has been given to advance towards Onega.

Schörner was unfazed by his plan's predictability, and ploughed on.\n\n"Indeed, my Führer, the plan is self-evident in its value. Had we completed the fortifications rather than resting on our laurels prematurely, the Soviets would never have been able to regroup and push us back, and Himmler's failed coup would have never even begun. Late as we are, completing the line is the only way to ensure the Russians never have a chance to retake Moskau."\n\nThe Führer thought that Schörner's concern had little to do with the ideology or national security, and much more to do with the influence he would gain with the troops on the eastern frontier. The line may have some strategic value, but it would likely be outweighed by the colossal cost of building a wall across a whole continent.

 goering.1225.desc:0 "Vadim's shoulders burned as he swung his mattock. The icy Russian soil refused to give in easily - the constant movement of cart wheels and caterpillar tracks had churned up thick, wet mud, that over repeated cycles of freezing and thawing had created half a dozen layers of frozen ground that was closer to rock than dirt. A little extra strength would be appreciated, preferably that of a jackhammer or one of those excavators he'd seen on the back of the German trucks, but those were too valuable to be risked in the unskilled hands of a conscript such as himself.\n\nVadim allowed himself a brief moment to catch his breath and wipe the sweat from his brow, which had gathered there despite the cloud his breath produced in the cold. As he breathed, he surveyed the horizon. From his section of the would-be trench, half sunk into the earth, he could see but a small segment of the fortifications extent. He had never seen anything like it. He'd heard tales of distant China, where a great wall separated the civilised world from the barbarians to the north. This was the only comparison he could even consider relevant. For as far as the eye could see, and from what he'd heard a thousand times further and yet more, Russians like him laboured digging trenches, cutting down forests, draining swamps, hanging barbed wire, installing bunkers, fortifying choke points - building a wall the likes of which the world had never seen.\n\n"What's the holdup, Russkie?" His reverie was interrupted by a bark in German - outside the trench, the soldier supervising his group was looking down at him and idly playing with the action of his rifle.\n\n"Just catching my breath, sir," he replied in rudimentary German. Vadim swallowed as the soldier walked to the lip of the trench. Seeing his discomfort, the German chuckled and spat into the trench, narrowly missing Vadim.\n\n"Back to work. No unsanctioned breaks." Vadim nodded, relieved he had avoided a beating."

 goering.1226.desc:0 "Vadim had not left the trench for weeks. He and the other conscripts had been thrown a tarpaulin and were expected to make do - the dribble of rain pushing its way through the gaps in the sheeting draped over the squalid hole had turned the freshly excavated dirt straight back into mud, and most of his comrades had taken to sleeping upright to avoid drowning in mud, propped up by their tools. Well, it was mostly mud - the digging of latrines had been deemed a secondary priority compared to the main fortifications, and there were few Russians willing to leave the trench at night, when a trigger-happy German might take a simple toilet break for an escape attempt. If Vadim poked his head out from under their tarpaulin, he could see the corpse pile. He could smell it no matter where he was.\n\nThe Germans kept separate from the Russians in their tents, but Vadim had been able to overhear a few words while on duty - most of the soldiers assumed the Russians were incapable of understanding their language, despite the fact around half the conscripts were Muscovite, and many of the others had picked up smatterings of the trade language that had built up around what used to be the border between Moskowien and Russia. Despite the brutal punishments that were being dealt with increasing regularity to the "lazy" workers, work was apparently proceeding according to schedule. Once the work was done, Russia would be split in two, with a border not nearly so porous as that that preceded it. What would become of him then? Shipped out to another conflict, to dig holes and live in his own shit, or just disposed of, another face in the corpse pile? There must be some way out, some path between the sentries that would take him away. They wouldn't bother searching for him once he was out, he was all but worthless - that much was clear. But which way? Back west into Moskowien, and hope to remain unnoticed by the authorities? Or east into Russia, where who knows what awaited him? He'd heard the Soviet Union was restored in the far east, but then he'd also heard of bandits masquerading as Germans who would slaughter anyone they deemed too Russian.\n\nThe crack of a distant gunshot reached the trench, and a few of the others shifted in their sleep. Vadim's grip tightened around his mattock, and he dreamed of freedom."

For the first time in what felt like weeks, Vadim had been allowed a break, for there was no more work to do. He and his Russian comrades, for all their hard work, had been awarded respite, a chance to lean on their shovels and gaze at the miles of trenches they had dug by hand. Vadim could have done with one of the beers the soldiers were passing round, but for now he was just grateful to have good, clean water. The radio was blaring out some patriotic German song, immediately following a speech by Führer Göring congratulating the troops and labourers - the German labourers, of course - on the completion of what he referred to as "Eighth Wonder of the World", the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan Line.\n\nThe division of Germany and Russia was now a sharp line on the map rather than the blur it had once been, in what many other young Russians considered a small golden age of enterprise compared to the Union and Reich that sandwiched them. The only enterprise getting done these days certainly wasn't sending the profits his way. He sipped his water, for the moment content. His shoulders no longer ached. He surveyed the wilderness expanse to the east, nothing but fields as far as the eye could see - no cover. Nothing but easy shooting should some young asshole look up from his drinking and back to his duties. But still, there was no time left, they'd be moving out soon. The best thing he could see was a gully, a few hundred metres away leading southeast. If he could reach there in a couple of hours, when drinking and darkness had dulled their senses, he might be able to crawl out of sight.\n\nThe rumble of a truck interrupted his thoughts, and he turned. The truck was backing up to the trench, where his comrades were enjoying their rest. Soldiers, their rifles shouldered and looking much more sober than their drunken friends were accompanying it.\n\n"Russkies, in the truck! Next project." Vadim gazed into the back of the truck like it was a gaping pit. He was out of time."

When he finally stopped laughing, reduced to a mere occasional, involuntary chuckle, he wiped his eyes of tears and sat straight.\n\n"All this time, we've been saying 'Ridiculous! Russia could never work together, never follow the same cause, Slavic barbarians this, Asiatic hordes that, and the thing that does it, that proves us wrong, is us!'" Göring continued to chuckle, and Axmann relaxed - this evidently would be a less difficult meeting than he'd expected.\n\n"Very amusing indeed.

While it is possible that their own military factories aren't enough since they've fought too much wars in these months, what makes this order strange is, their price is so high that they've never offered before.\n\nIn our government, whether should we accept this order or not has immediately become our most important topic. Most ministers think it means that we've earned trust for the Germans and they're willing to show us more respect, so why shouldn't we accept their kindness?

The Kriegsmarine has already put forward a number of monitor and blockade vessels, but it is clear the fleets will need to be buttressed in size if we are to be successful. The only question then is to determine the requisite size of the task force needed, and a proposal has been put forward...\n\nBy redirecting a handful of other vessels from patrols in the North Sea and the Atlantic we could possibly achieve an operational blockade. However, the admiralty has stressed in no uncertain terms that this 'pittance' of ships will not stop a determined foreign power from penetrating the naval cordon. They request - insist, in truth - that the deployment of the fleets in the region be redirected to create a floating wall that will ensure an absolute blockade of Portugal.\n\nYet, such a massive fleet concentration in a global flashpoint runs the risk of engaging the globe's naval powers; a challenge by America's Navy could arise and would have the potential to spiral into something far worse."

It was beginning to wear on the men.\n\n'Sonar.' It was a command, not a question. A furtive moment passed before the young officer looked up from his display and slipped the headset off of his ears. 'Biological contacts, bearing 273.' The man rubbed his eyes. 'Whales, sir.'\n\nThe Captain looked out to the horizon, perhaps in an effort to spy an enemy himself where the ship's sensors could not. The man was genuinely disappointed. His superiors in the Admiralty pushed for more ships to be deployed to secure the blockade, true, but they sincerely hoped the Americans would be drawn out by their challenge. He knew they would cower in the face of their naval dominance, but to not send any response at all? Not a single task force, or even a single blockade runner?

With both the Führer and Schörner present, the officers make their proposals to increase efficiency and protect our supply lines: everything goes smoothly, until the issue of France is brought up.\n\nWhile both the French State and Brittany are fully inside our sphere of influence - a general argues - and won't deny passage to our troops and supply convoys, their infrastructure isn't as developed as we might need, and anti-German partisans are almost sure to try and disrupt our offensive, and local police isn't notorious for its efficacy in fending off terrorists. For this reason - he notes - it might be advantageous to impose our authority completely on the remnants of the French Republic. With their armies almost nonexistent, and their governments weak, it would be a matter of hours to replace them with a German administration fully committed to the war effort.\n\nAnother general replies that Brittany is an important trade port, and removing its government, no matter how corrupt it is, would hit the German economy hard: while occupying France might be a good idea, Brittany is best left formally independent. Finally, a third suggests not to execute such a plan, and instead sign more favorable agreements with the two governments: fully occupying any of the two countries would only infuriate potential partisans, and force us to detach several garrisons, distracting our troops from the Iberian front.\n\nAs the High Command can't find an agreement, the decision falls to the Führer.

On the other, we can equally spread the development efforts between all administrative units: this would be more costly and less efficient, but no one would complain about lack of funds.

With great leverage in the industrial heart of Catalonia, they can count on thousands of collaborators, sleeper agents and infiltrated assets within the former regional government: despite our efforts, our necessity to rely on previous administrative structured will surely allow some of this scum to persist.\n\nKnowing this, the High Command has suggested we give a demonstration of our power to the population of Barcelona, in order to force them to comply with terror. We have three options on the table: the first is to let the collaborators impart a couple "lessons" on obedience, by conducting a large-scale anti-anarchist operation with the support of tanks. The second is to leave this to the Heer, and shell the city for an entire day with the artillery: this will leave the city in ruins, destroying their symbols and their very identity. Finally, we can show our own version of "mercy" and limit ourselves to a show action, destroying several suspected holdouts of the anarchists. What should we do?"

Surely some of them share our views, and many more must have realized by now that the war is going to end soon, in our favor: all those we convince to switch sides now will form the foundation of a collaborator movement to bolster our occupation forces!\n\nHowever, the Iberian counterintelligence will surely try to hinder our recruiting efforts, which means we have to concentrate on a single front.

First the soldiers of the Frente Azul refused to fight alongside the collaborators, then came the brawls, then knife fights, and finally the two sides started shooting at each other: yesterday, a German officer who tried to broker an armistice got caught in the fire and died!\n\nWith several German witnesses present to the murder scene, it's evident that all the fault is to be blamed on the Frente. They started the hostilities, and even refuse to apologize for the officer's death, saying it was the collaborators' fault!

In order to try and save funds for other campaigns, we could employ collaborators, mostly the soldiers who deserted from the enemy after our recruitment efforts: they would be much cheaper to employ, and would be more efficient in infiltrating the partisan organizations, though their loyalty isn't certain.\n\nOn the other hand, we could play safe and rely on our own operatives to run the agency.

Not content with the wanton destruction they had caused, the bastards stole all equipment they could take and then disappeared in the sewers!\n\nNow, the ASB faces harsh criticism from the High Command in Germania for their inability to predict and thwart such a large partisan operation.

While I consider such thoughts borderline treasonous, and have taken utmost care to ensure that no one dares to put their Führer's dedication to the final victory of the Reich over its enemies, this doesn't remove my worries.\n\nIn order to ease the worries of these prominent members of the Oberkommando, and prove to them that, indeed, their leader listens to their thoughts and desires, I humbly demand that an investigation is launched and, should it be proved that someone indeed plotted to endanger von Hirschfeld's tenure or even his life, that all those involved in such a heinous plan are punished in an exemplary way.

As things are, we are forced to defeat their rebellion before we can claim total victory in iberia.\n\nWe can choose, however, how to deal with them after we have defeated their army. On one hand, we can limit ourselves to crush their puny attempt at independence without further retaliations on the population: this would be respectful of their Aryan birthright, but it might be seen as too lenient.

Even after defeating their army, the people kept fighting our occupation, requiring draconian measures to prevent a full-scale uprising from happening. However, the efforts of the garrisons were for nothing, as a large revolt happened in Bilbao a few days ago.\n\nElements of the Basque militias who had been hiding in the mountains descended on the city and slaughtered the garrison before they could evacuate. Of course, the answer was immediate, and the uprising crushed in blood, but this doesn't change the horrors that happened there. Our soldiers were forced to advance house by house, razing the city to the ground and killing almost everyone they met, as there was no way to differentiate between civilians and military: men and women, old and young, fought to the death amidst the ruins of their city.\n\nEven though order has been restored, morale in the army has fallen very low, as they can't understand why would fellow Aryans fight so fiercely against their liberators."

A tremendous detonation enveloped the vehicle leading the motorcade, the force of the blast throwing it against a building more than twenty meters from the road, and it was only by pure chance that Feldmarschall Schörner survived: his car had passed in second position after its engine had a small problem, and despite being involved in the explosion, it was spared the brunt of the detonation, the general himself only suffering flesh wounds from glass shards as the window broke from the shockwave.\n\nPreliminary investigations report that a partisan cell dug a tunnel under the road from a small apartment they had rented weeks before the parade.

We have two leads currently on French and Belgian contacts but we will need further time to verify their authenticity lest we fall into a Burgundian counterintelligence.\n\nAs for potential informants within the regime, we do at least know the names of some, but the list is from before the Bürgerkrieg and given the high rate of turnover amongst the Burgundian officials coupled with possible changes in willingness to cooperate, we cannot rely heavily on this information. We have agents in the field conducting check-ins on the names to confirm or not the status of these potential assets.

For the few agents that managed to make it to their targets, they had no opportunity to commit any actual sabotage. The rest were captured en-route, which may explain the heightened security.\n\nOur agents' morale has taken a serious hit.

Our safehouses were then quickly located and destroyed. Very few of our agents made it out of the country alive, and those that did are not exactly rushing to be deployed there again.

The Abwehr is drafting up plans to sabotage army barracks, slave camps, some of the more important factories, and even SS officer quarters!

All it took for the plan to fall apart was one agent getting caught trying to infiltrate a camp disguised as a slave. What gave him away? He looked 'too healthy.' The agent gave up his fellows after hours of brutal torture; the vast majority of his comrads were likewise captured or killed, with very few of their objects being successfully damaged.\n\nThis failure has not only cost us lives, but also given away our intentions. Himmler now knows that it was the Reich who has been meddling in his petty kingdom, and he will likely act accordingly. Tensions between us have risen to unforeseen levels as a result."

Himmler has to know that some major power is responsible, but our involvement in sowing disarray is still unknown.\n\nThe Burgadian military is crippled after this latest wave of attacks. Many of their officers have been taken out of commission, their major factories are more or less shut down, and we have sown enough dissent in the slave camps to at least slow down their output significantly.

However, the Abwehr is confident that they can get the job done; with the SS in chaos at home, they argue that there is no better time than now than to launch an undercover operation to steal codebooks.\n\nThey may very well be right; there may not be another window of opportunity like this.

The issue is that...\n\nThey never came out.\n\nAbout a day after our men were last seen, nearly all of our safehouses in Burgundy were raided; most of our agents were compromised in the crackdown. It's safe to say that the operation went horribly wrong; our men probably got captured, and then likely were horribly tortured to death, but not before they gave up sensitive information, if the raids are anything to go by.\n\nWe knew the risks, and now we have to deal with the consequences. The SS likely know that it was without a doubt us who have been sabotaging their backlines. Tensions are without a doubt going to rise; it remains to be seen if they will boil over or not."

It seems the men got caught up in a briefing, and had no choice but to blend in. It's a miracle they didn't get caught!\n\nAlready, we are learning valuable Burgaidan secrets. Locations of secret missile silos, their military capability, locations of major stockpiles, and more are being reviled to our men as we speak. And the best part? The SS are none the wiser."

The Abwehr has been working on cracking these hidden cells, and believe they may have a lead! If they manage to find something solid and trace the bread crumb trail, we may be able to expose most of Himmler's informants!\n\nOf course, failure is a possibility. If the spy network discovers that we're on to them, they may go deeper underground, or even act against the agents attempting to smoke them out.

Several of the men working leads on this operation have mysteriously gone missing; we only have one report of one of our men being kidnapped out of his house at night in Essen; we imagine the other dozen men have met similar fates and are likely dead already. To make matters worse, Himmler himself will have gotten word that we are focusing efforts on curbing SS influence, which will more than likely raise tensions between us."

From there, it was relatively easy to crack down on the rest of the spy ring. Although we know for a fact that SS agents and sympathisers slipped through our net, more than a hundred informants have been arrested! The Abwehr is confident that they have broken the back of the spy network; Himmler, for the foreseeable future, does not have eyes in our administration."

He actually didn't have anything to report; his sector was all quiet; he was just calling to confirm the unthinkable for himself. But instead of hearing nothing, like he was told he'd hear from his peers, Heinrich Himmler himself was on the phone. The tone was unmistakable.\n\n"Uh... yes. I'm sending half of my corps to reinforce the northern border as we speak, sir!" A lie. For a spur of the moment one though, not bad. He could give the orders when he got off the phone. A moment of silence passed. How the Hell did he manage to make a few seconds of quiet feel like an hour.\n\n"Your... initiative is commendable during these times, Müller. I'm glad to hear that. I have other matters to attend to, but expect further orders within very soon." The phone went dead, Himmler had hung up on him. Müller took a breath and allowed himself a sigh of relief before he wiped his tears off his face. He looked down at his phone, then punched in his adjutant's number."

The people of Burgundy had surely had enough of Himmler?\n\n"Nothing, sir." The Abwehr officer stared dead ahead, not making eye contact with his Führer. "Every part of the operation was carried out as planned. Satellite and radio monitoring showed no change. One of our informants noticed the literature shellings. Apart from one unfortunate victim of the first impact, the books just... stayed there.

High ranking admirals are insisting that we need to either downsize our fleet or find new ports to dock our ships in.\n Neither option is at all enticing, as we are forced to either greatly reduce the Reich's power projection (essentially a non-option) or invade other countries to use their ports. Voices from the Kriegsmarine are "requesting" (which, if we ignore, may lead to things getting ugly) that we take over Britain and Norway in order to make use of their facilities.\nIt seems that there is actually no choice at all; launch those invasions or face the ever-growing power and wrath of the militarists."

According to special intelligence, areas of Germany heavily under the control of Speidel and Schörner have very limited air support loyal to them, and as such has provided us a unique opportunity to scout on our opposition. By using our aerial superiority to discover and locate the bases of the enemy, we would obtain a strategic advantage which would provide our Luftwaffe with a tactical advantage should any conflict break out within the Reich.\n\nThe plan, while sound, does come with a few flaws.

The loyalty and high regard that the military old guard held for him was unmatched, and the sacking of the old Field Marshall has perhaps only compounded their respect and loyalty for him.\n\nFollowing our failure to find a suitable replacement for the old general in the wake of his sacking, Schörner has wasted not one moment in rallying his base of support around him. Within days, secretive contingency plans were hurriedly dusted off by disloyal militarists. Telephone lines were choked full with frantic and urgent phone calls between military officers around the Reich, enacting all sorts of plans and declaring a plethora of emergency codes.\n\nErratic and unordered military movements have been reported from Elsass to the farthest reaches of our Eastern frontiers. Several prominent members of the military high command have hurriedly fled Germania, as the Oberkommandos report that communication with countless Luftwaffe, Kriegsmarine, and Heer contingents appears to have been severed. Those few of the General staff who remain in Germania frantically scramble to establish some form of image of the current situation we find ourselves suddenly embroiled in.\n\nBut there is no question as to what's going on.

His veterancy as an officer in the campaigns against the French, Polish, and Russians decades ago should prove popular among the men of the armed forces, and his undeniable charm should surely win over many dissident militarists within the ranks.\n\nWhilst his charm and ground experience is undeniable, it remains to be seen how the militarists will receive the appointment of the young Reichskommissar to the nation's highest military post. The Field Marshal is swamped with allegations of corruption which he has so far been able to charismatically talk himself out of, and the snubbing of more senior members of the old guard will surely agitate many.

This sudden and unannounced vacation came mere hours following his swift and unexpected resignation from his post as Chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht.\n\nAs a suddenly retired Müller took flight towards Africa, Hermann Göring was left dumbfounded. It was to the Führer's understanding that Müller had understood the situation, and was willing to encumber the task set before him. Why the hell would he suddenly resign, fleeing the nation entirely? None of this made sense to him.\n\nYet, the pieces began to come together. Seemingly within moments of Müller's resignation and flight, Feldmarschall Speidel began to pick up the pieces that were hurriedly left behind, almost as if he expected this series of events to occur. Speidel has now reached out to the Führer about taking up the mantle of OKW chief to swiftly seal the vacuum that has suddenly appeared once again, and has already begun issuing directives amongst several military elements as if he were already in-charge.\n\nWith a fast deteriorating situation, it is clear that Speidel has assumed more effective control over the armed forces than any other man has to this point, and the Führer does not see many other options laid out before him."

The post that he had longed for the return of for years.\n\nDespite Speidel's undeniable effectiveness in wrangling the several ideological wings of the military, relations have always been chilly between the veteran Feldmarschall and the Führer. Ever since Speidel delayed what Göring sees as his rightful ascension into Germania in 1963, the Führer has severely distrusted the veteran Field Marshal. Yet, as the crisis began to unfold throughout the Reich as the military sat without a central commander, Göring knew that he must set aside the distrust he held in order to preserve his own increasingly fragile reign.\n\nSpeidel's re-ascension to commandership over the Wehrmacht comes at an ever increasingly trying time for the Reich, reminiscent of the opening days of the Bürgerkrieg years ago. Now Germans find themselves asking but one question: Will Speidel be able to preserve the situation and hold together Göring's Reich?"

Could the Führer really have been so bold as to appoint his family into the highest post achievable by a member of the German military?\n\nThe eyes of the nation did not deceive them. Heinrich Theodore Göring has been appointed by the Führer as the head of the Wehrmacht in this time of crisis. A former second world war luftwaffe pilot turned career officer, he has had a long career in the armed forces, but not as fruitful a career as many other candidates that stood in line for the military's top job. Surely, Heinrich Göring was appointed by the Führer to act as a loyal puppet in control of the Wehrmacht, something that he has lacked from the start of his reign.

 goering.2018.desc:0 "To say that the sacking of Feldmarschall Schörner was controversial would be a gigantic understatement. Even with Führer Göring's efforts to decrease Schörner's massive influence in the Heer, parts of the army protested furiously against what they saw as the final straw in a long list of the Führer's aggression against the army. For being a militarist, as he so claimed, Göring was taking quite the turn towards Bolshevism- at least, that's what the protestors claimed.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Speidelites applauded Schörner's removal. However, this approval has quickly turned into fear of their own. Whispers of Schörner attempting another coup rippled through Speidel's supporters, and soon they became as paranoid as the Schörnerites. If Schörner truly was trying a second coup, would Göring stop him? What would happen to Speidel? What would happen to them?\n\nFrom this moment on, perhaps the consequences of such an earthshaking push was inevitable. Divisions reported to headquarters more and more infrequently, strange new "exercises'' were scheduled and rescheduled- most importantly, Herr Schörner headed east to give a "speaking tour", and Feldmarschall Speidel headed north for "administrative duties." All of these actions were viewed with suspicion, but nothing could be done about them- nothing would rock the boat harder than arresting Schörner and Speidel.\n\nAs it turns out, one doesn't need to rock the boat when it's already sinking.\n\nAs of now, Schörner and thousands of soldiers march on Germania, determined to right the wrongs that Göring has pushed onto them. Their intentions, while not outright stated, are beyond clear. To the north, Speidel marches south on Germania, presumably in a coup attempt of his own, or perhaps solely to stop Schörner from completing his own. Germania itself is in a state of chaos, as thousands flee into the countryside from the impending battle. The Führer's only hope now is that his new Feldmarschall remains loyal to his side..."

Though they tried their best to assert themselves once more, they couldn't realize that this was their own fault. For all their might in equipment and men, nothing weakened them so much more than corruption. Their greed, now left unchecked, led to the wasting away of their great war machines and the shattering of their ranks. Without such instruments, nothing can be taken back.\n\nAnd just like Göring, they meant nothing to the men who shattered his country. Germany, once again, was divided.

Earlier, it had been the point of resistance which claimed more lives than necessary.

What is unprecedented, however, are the reports that have been flowing in from our men who have been fighting alongside Göring's forces.\n\nReports indicate that, rather than holding prisoners of war from this conflict in conventional holding camps, as would be befitting of fellow German combatants, those captured are rather being forced into intensive labour camps under horrific conditions. One camp was reportedly so overfull following the surrender of an enemy division, that the conditions described within the camp beckon to the treatment of captured Soviets in the 1940s. The prisoners in these camps were described as being made to do industrial labour, being forced to meet quotas. Most in the camps wear the tattered uniforms of Heer conscripts. The occasional officer is also scattered about the prisoner populace, bearing his old uniform, but none of the dignity that once came with it. Some prisoners, oddly, suspiciously brandish no uniforms at all, and drag about in seemingly civilian clothing.\n\nYet, most concerning to us, is that one battalion of ours that was passing by one of Göring's camps was recognized by the prisoners inside the camp, who began frantically calling out the names of the soldiers in our passing battalion. For those prisoners were of the same battalion, captured weeks ago by Schörners forces. Demanding to know the meaning of the imprisonment of his soldiers, the battalion commander and his men forced their way into the camp, liberating all those who belonged to their forces. It appeared that those men were placed into a prisoner of war camp when captured by Schörner's forces, only to be liberated by Göring's armies days later. But rather than liberation, they were hushed and placed into another camp. The Führer's labour camp.\n\nSuch criminal treatment of our soldiers is intolerable, and all those in our general staff agree. Outraged, many are calling for us to sever our ties with Hermann Göring entirely, citing that he has gone too far and treated our men as if they were Jewry.

He was clearly not interested in such. He had an ultimatum to give.\n\nApparently, a battalion underneath his command managed to force their way into one of our prisoner of war camps. Within, they claim to have found several of their men among the prisoners, and proceeded to break those men out of our camp. Dumbfounded after being confronted by a friendly force, our guards did little to prevent the chaos.\n\nThe fact does remain, however, that prisoners are not vetted to determine who they fight for. All prisoners of war encountered are simply determined to be hostile, and are rounded along into the labour programmes. Such programmes are essential to the war effort, and it may not be advisable to set a precedent of granting freedom to any prisoner that some unruly commander decides to bring into his ranks. Furthermore, allowing factionalists to make demands of the Führer would be an unacceptable degradation of the Führerprinzip. However, Speidel is a valuable ally.

Now, as the dust settles upon a new Europe, Führer Schörner can proclaim the triumph of strength over weakness.\n\nSpeidel, his belly yellow from cowardice and face green with envy, desired to strip the nation of all its grandeur in pursuit of pseudo-Bolshevik reform. Göring, that fat puppet draped in capes and garnet rings like a Weimar whore, sought to feebly seize control of his own strings. Such cowards had been writhing on every step of the stairway to glory, clawing and grasping at Schörner and his men like children. At long last, the sweetness of true victory can be tasted in the air like smoke on a battlefield.\n\nThe continent has been carved up to serve the Reich: From the north of Scandinavia to the north of Africa, from the west of Europe to the west of Russia, a beautiful new future has been secured for the younger generations. As long as there are partisan scum infesting the Reich's territories, there is ample opportunity to send Aryan boys on the grand path to manhood with a uniform and a rifle.\n\nThe days of treason are finally over. True, there will be a few vestiges of filth clinging to the boot of Germany, but due diligence would soon see these traitorous sacks of meat stuffed into a truck, handed a rifle and carted off to the frozen wastelands of the Russian frontier.

A speech soon to be transmitted per Radio to all areas of the world, that the Reich held sway over.\n\n"This day may be one of the greatest in the history of the Reich. Peace is upon us!

An order that is strong, not savage. Forward looking, not stagnant. United, not fractured. A pact of peace, a pact of progress, a pact of unity that deserves the name!" When it was done he finished with a simple "Heil the Pakt". Making a speech was the easy part. Now the difficult one would begin. He would have to undo the damage done by the war and Göring's policies and put some sustainable alternative into place.

Yes, it was not one of the many vying states in Iberia itself that has one out and restored some semblance of order to this region in chaos, but the war machine with a state that is the modern incarnation of Führer Hermann Göring's Reich. The Iberian Federal Government, the Basque, the Catalans, the Portuguese, all of these and more fell beneath the advancing boots of the Wehrmacht and the falling bombs of the Luftwaffe. With every contender eliminated Göring has ordered the region once under the domain of the Iberian Union to be balkanized into some half a dozen Reichskommissariats, most of whom are led by members of Hans Speidel's faction or members of the "New Guard" of the military high command. How this will affect the dynamics of the armed forces remains to be seen."

 goering_successor.1.t:0 "The Successor Speaks"
 goering_successor.1.desc:0 "The Reichsmarschall swaggered to the front of the crowd with confidence, his trademark grin stretching from ear to ear. Today he was adorned in his blue Luftwaffe uniform, its medals clanking as he took his position behind the podium. Behind him stood his most loyal advisors: the bespectacled Ferdinand Schörner, the sneering Otto Ernst Remer, the smartly suited Wilhelm Stuckart.\n\n"Members of the Reichstag," Göring spoke after a few moments of silence, gripping the podium tightly with his jewelled fingers. "I have humbly accepted the Führer's offer to become his official successor. Many of you will know that such a proposition has been enshrined in our law since 1938. I am proud to say that the strength of our relationship has only grown in this time." His eyes, blue and narrow, dragged themselves across the brown masses of the Reichstag. "The Reich, however, has only weakened! As your Führer, I promise to drag us from the marshy swamp of our own making and into a glorious new era!" His voice grew slightly strained as he continued the speech. "I shall deliver us into an age of absolute military domination over our foes. Make no mistake. The Führer's vision for Europe must be completed!"\n\nA sporadic wave of applause swept through the crowd, emanating largely from the militarists and Wehrmacht officers, but also from a few conservatives. Göring gave an uneasy smile and glanced behind him, where Schörner was watching on eagerly.\n\n"To strengthen our beautiful Vaterland," Göring continued, "we must save our economy from the clutches of those who wish to exploit it for their own selfish purposes. You know who I'm talking about!" Göring's voice grew more energetic, and he puffed out his chest in excitement. "I'm talking about the parasitic German bankers! I'm talking about the Swiss! Let us revitalize our economy, let us re-energize the German workforce, let us abolish wasteful spending on useless projects that plague the Reich!""
 goering_successor.1.a:0 "A wonderful speech, Herr Göring!"

 goering_successor.2.t:0 "One Bad Photo..."
 goering_successor.2.desc:0 ""Let's try one with a far-off look," Göring instructed the young photographer. He looked dramatically to the side, brow furrowed in stern thought. The camera clicked multiple times. He was wearing his personalized dove-gray uniform, complete with medals. He turned back to the photographer. "Bernhard, was it? Ah, Bertold. My apologies. Show me yesterday's photograph. The one with the blue Luftwaffe uniform." Bertold brought the printed photo over. "Hmm... I want that one destroyed. This is going in the newspapers, remember. I must look my best."\n\nSchörner arrived in the doorway with a small document tucked under his arm. Göring beckoned him over and examined the papers. The Feldmarschall had drafted a plan to violently suppress the student protests that had broken out since his appointment as successor. Bertold was prowling around the room, experimenting with different angles and muttering to himself. The young photographer had probably been a student himself, not so long ago. Göring gave a heavy sigh. He handed the document back and nodded his approval. Oh well. The students had been growing more and more unruly. It was time they were taught a lesson.\n\n"Reichsmarschall Göring," the photographer whispered in a shaking voice, drawing Göring from his thoughts. "I took a photograph of your plan. The one ordering Heer troops to use brutal force against the peaceful student protests. I will leak this photo unless you cancel this order immediately. Is that understood?"\n\nGöring stared at the young man in shock, but said nothing. He simply rose to his feet, thanked him for his time, and walked over to the waiting Schörner. The officer noticed his glum expression, and looked over at Bertold with suspicion."
 goering_successor.2.a:0 "That photographer is a threat, Ferdinand. Eliminate him."
 goering_successor.2.b:0 "Make sure that young man knows how unhappy I am!"
 
 goering_successor.3.t:0 "A Bad Fall"
 goering_successor.3.desc:0 ""Here is the photograph, Reichsmarschall," Schörner said smugly, sliding the brown envelope across the dinner table. Göring looked up from his hearty meal with a chuckle, shaking the contents of the envelope onto the table. Wilhelm Stuckart lowered his fork and frowned in confusion.\n\n"No need to worry yourself, Wilhelm," Göring grinned as he inspected the photo. The image was of Göring sitting down on a chair and inspecting a document. One of the papers was hanging loosely in full view of the camera, detailing much of Schörner's plans against the student protests. "We'll get back to matters of policy in a second."\n\n"I regret to inform you that our good friend Bertold took a nasty fall from his apartment window," Schörner shook his head in mock grief. "He was quite high up, I'm afraid."\n\n"He must have been taking photos of the sky!" Göring roared with laughter, slamming the table in his hand. He wiped a tear from his eye and turned to Stuckart. "You haven't got a lighter, have you?" He plucked the lighter from his advisor's palm and lit it underneath the image with glee. The bright yellow flames licked across the photograph, contorting the image as it folded and blackened. Göring watched on with satisfaction, the flames reflected in his pale blue eyes."

 goering_successor.4.t:0 "A Fatal Leak"
 goering_successor.4.desc:0 ""Could you... could you portray a calmer expression, perhaps?" Johann asked politely to the Reichsmarschall, who was posing with one foot on a stool and a hand clasped around his Luftwaffe baton. His cloak was blowing magnificently behind him, thanks to the chilly gusts of wind from the open window.\n\n"I'll give you calm!" Göring yelled, breaking his pose and kicking the stool over. Naturally, Göring had hired a new photographer. Someone more professional. Someone older. Someone less likely to support Speer. That didn't stop him from getting on his nerves.\n\nSchörner arrived at the doorway. Göring strode over him with a thunderous expression and swung his baton, hitting the Feldmarschall in the side of the arm. The officer looked more shocked than hurt.\n\n"You useless fucking idiot! I told you to exterminate that little rat Bertold! Why the fuck is he still alive to leak photos of our plan? The protests have tripled in size!" Göring was about to throw his baton to the floor in fury but stopped himself at the last moment. It was too precious to risk breaking. "That agent you sent to deal with Bertold? The one who got fucking caught? I want him liquidated immediately."\n\n"Is that necessary, Hermann?" Schörner responded with gritted teeth, rubbing his sore arm. Any other day, he would have exploded with fury. "Does it matter what the students think? They weren't going to support you anyway."\n\n"Have. Him. Liquidated. I won't ask again. And don't you dare call me Hermann!" He felt a wave of smugness as Schörner nodded in compliance. It wasn't often he had such power over the officer. The smugness swiftly faded, however, as images of violent student riots exploded in his head."

The protests have tripled in size!"\n\n"My apologies, Hermann" Schörner responded with gritted teeth, rubbing his sore arm. Any other day, he would have exploded with fury. "Does it matter what the students think?"\n\n"Of course it bloody matters!" Göring exclaimed. "And don't you dare call me Hermann!""

 goering_successor.6.t:0 "The Army Marches On"
 goering_successor.6.desc:0 "Claus winced at the screeches that drilled into his ears. Masses of students bustled before him, waving placards and bricks alike, screaming at the armed soldiers like banshees. A large papier-mâché head was floating above the crowd with thin evil eyes and a feline grin, mockingly painted in makeup. There were several chants, disparate and sporadic, but the loudest without question was: "Down with Göring!"\n\nClaus gripped his rifle tightly and looked towards his comrades for assurance. He was 18 years old and fresh out of training. He had imagined being sent to the beautiful expanses of the snowy eastern front, or down in the exotic jungles of Afrika. He did not expect to be facing down fellow Germans for his first assignment.\n\nSoldiers were pushing forwards, screaming at the protestors to disperse. The closest cluster backed away instantly, apart from one girl who thrust her anti-Göring sign forwards and screamed back. One of the soldiers walked up and smashed her in the face with the butt of his rifle.\n\n"Disperse!" Claus yelled. His voice cracked. He raised his rifle at the students, who dropped their signs and darted. He saw a group of soldiers tackling a pair of brick-throwers to the ground and smashing them to a bloody pulp with their boots. Another comrade fired a shot into the papier-mâché head, which exploded as the crowd nearby broke apart with a cry. Claus did not let the fear overtake him. He was a soldier of the Reich. Sure, these were fellow Germans... students, around his age... but they were protesting against the next Führer, against the Reich. Anyone who protests against the Reich protests against the German people. One of the demonstrators lobbed a brick towards him, missing the young soldier by a few inches. Claus brought his rifle up and fired into the student's legs, forcing him to the ground. "I SAID, DISPERSE!""

 goering_successor.7.t:0 "Triumph In Germania"
 goering_successor.7.desc:0 "Hermann Göring looked down at the grandiose display before him. He gripped onto the ledge of the balcony with one hand and waved his jewel-encrusted baton with the other. To enrapture the German people, he thought to himself with a smile, one must appeal to their base instincts: War, military, and grandeur. He had ordered a display of power on a grand scale not seen since the glorious celebrations following the triumph of the Second Welktkrieg. It had been expensive, of course, but his revitalization of the economy following the Führer's inevitable demise would more than make up for it.\n\nA sense of pride surged through him as the Hermann Göring Division marched onwards to lead the procession. The splendor of those uniforms, the synchronization of their steps, and sheer beauty of those mechanicals creatures rolling forward... it was almost too much to handle. He was enraptured by his own propaganda! Göring chuckled softly. Perhaps he would build a statue of himself in Germania? One for Hitler too, of course, but maybe ever so slightly smaller than his...\n\n"Stop prattling, Feldmarschall!" Göring laughed as he turned towards Ferdinand Schörner, who was conferring intensely with Otto Ernst Remer and Johann von Kielmansegg. "You're missing the parade!""
 goering_successor.7.a:0 "Ah Ferdinand, did you see that Maus? Amazing!"
 
 goering_successor.8.t:0 "A Matter of Shooting First"
 goering_successor.8.desc:0 ""Heydrich must die." Göring folded his arms and prowled around the table, deep in thought. "He and his lackeys must be purged. We'll use the failed 50s coup as our explanation." Göring could feel a surge of energy spiking through him as he reeled off his list of foes. He hadn't felt this alive since 1934. "I still haven't decided on Heinrich Müller. He's a Bormannite, yes, but many of them will flock to my cause when I'm declared Führer."\n\n"He stays on the list. He's too much of a risk." Schörner was strumming his fingers against the table. "As for Speer's supporters, we should start with his merry band of Bolsheviks. Kiesinger, Schmidt, that loathsome Erhard, Treskow... they should all be hanged as traitors."\n\n"Not Treskow," Göring corrected. "He is a military man. He must be shot." The Night of the Long Knives had not been this complicated. Purging the SA leadership, a few conservatives, Party rivals - nothing compared to the political quagmire Göring had to navigate.\n\n"There are many rising officers that must be taken care of as well," Schörner continued. "Shot, if you insist."\n\n"Show me the list." Göring ran his eyes over the names with a frown. "Are these men even political?"\n\n"Perhaps not, but I certainly am," Schörner said with an unblinking stare. "If I weren't, you would not be in such a high standing with the Militarists."\n\n"If you think these deaths are necessary, then so be it," Göring muttered, understanding the threat. Was this how Hitler had felt all those years ago, as Göring nudged him into purging his own personal rivals?"
 goering_successor.8.a:0 "What we need is a Reich free of traitors and threats."
 
 goering_successor.9.t:0 "What's In A Name?"
 goering_successor.9.desc:0 ""Ah... excellent!" Göring threw the newspaper back onto the table and plucked up the next document. He scanned it intensely and shook his head with a tut. "This extract shows the Führer praising Goebbels, not me."\n\n"My apologies, Reichsmarschall," Herr Fischer said hastily. "My men have been scouring for weeks -"\n\n"Apologies are not necessary!" Göring laughed. "Just replace 'Joseph Goebbels' with 'Hermann Göring'. He's not going to complain from the grave, is he?" He picked up a transcript dated from September 1st 1939. It was one of Hitler's many speeches to the Reichstag. "Ahem. 'Should something happen to me in this battle, my first successor will be party member Göring'. Make sure this one is released first."\n\nNewspaper and speech extracts. Quotes by esteemed Party members. Newsreel footage of Hitler and Göring shaking hands, or standing side by side on the Reichstag balcony, or deliberating over war plans. Audio recordings of Hitler praising Göring. The successor had ordered his men to comb through all of it, compiling everything for detailed inspection. Once they had received his blessing, they would all be sent to the Ministry for Propaganda and Public Enlightenment and spread to the German people. The public had to be certain of the future Führer's legitimacy, and so he was presenting himself as the natural progression of leadership. For the average German, continuity means safety."

 goering_successor.10.desc:0 "Hauptmann Joseph Graf sucked on his cigarette as his men dug furiously, spraying soil in all directions. Some of the caches had been locked up in abandoned bunkers. Others had been placed in wooden boxes, hidden in storage facilities and falsely labelled. The Hauptmann, in all his boundless luck, had been instructed to uncover the ones buried underground.\n\nAs the Reich's political stage began to crumble alongside Hitler's health, Göring and Schörner had soon realized the inevitability of the impending civil war. A swift operation was initiated, in which weapons and other supplies were secretly diverted to hidden depots throughout the Reich. Now that the bloodshed had begun, it was time to unleash the concealed weaponry.\n\nThere was a loud clunk of a shovel hitting metal. One of the soldiers looked up at the officer with a grin. Hauptmann Graf stomped out his cigarette and spread his arms open."
 goering_successor.10.a:0 "Clean them all out boys!"
 
 goering_successor.11.t:0 "The Power of Money"
 goering_successor.11.desc:0 ""Heil Göring!" Schörner announced with a salute as he entered the war room. Despite the cruel fate that had befallen the Reich, Göring could not stop his chest swelling with pride when he heard such phrases. He saluted in response and beckoned the Feldmarschall in.\n\n"Come, come. We are discussing a push into Bormann's territory." Göring looked back down at the map and stroked his chin in thought. "Do you have anything to report?"\n\n"Yes, my Führer," Schörner responded smugly. He joined Remer and von Kielmansegg at the map. "Many of the Waffen-SS troops we bribed have followed through on their promises. They have arrived at our territory, and are ready to fight, as per your commands."\n\n"Excellent!" Göring slapped the table in excitement. "Heydrich will be furious! I want you to officially add this new unit into our army. Their skill set will be useful for very specific operations."\n\n"I shall begin planning immediately, my Führer," Schörner responded curtly, giving another salute and marching towards the door.\n\n"One more thing, Feldmarschal!" Göring called out. "This new division to be officially commissioned as the 'Waffen-SS Hermann Göring'. Understood?""
 goering_successor.11.a:0 "The Waffen-SS is loyal to the true Führer!"

 goering_successor.12.t:0 "A Wild Ace Appears"
 goering_successor.12.desc:0 "The recent Bürgerkrieg that has consumed the German Reich has so far been an almost exclusively ground affair, fought on the boots of infantrymen, the wheels of trucks, and the treads of tanks. That was, until this morning. Residents and soldiers alike of Reichsmarschall Göring's territory looked up to the sky just in time to see a bolt of lighting arc through the skies and towards the enemy lines.\n\nThe pilot of this craft? Johannes 'Macky' Steinhoff, top ace of the loyal Luftwaffe and a veteran of both the Second World War and the West Russian War. Steinhoff distinguished himself as the first operational pilot of the Luftwaffe's crowning joy during the Second World War, Me 262 jet. Tragically, Steinhoff was significantly burned across much of his body in a horrific crash during one of his take offs. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Steinhoff was one of the leading Luftwaffe instructors, but his desire to support his beloved Luftwaffe was so great that he immediately resigned his position and volunteered to fly once more.\n\nGöring, former Reichsmarschall des Luftwaffe of the German Reich, has personally congratulated Steinhoff, and offered him a promotion once the war for Germany has been won."

 goering_successor.13.t:0 "A Meeting In The Beer Hall"
 goering_successor.13.d:0 "Reichsmarshall Göring sat in his normal chair the Burgerbraukeller Beer Hall, the one he had occupied since his time as a would-be revolutionary all those years ago with Adolf and the others. It was not the past he was here to meet however, but the future. That was why he was constantly checking his custom-made, lavishly expensive watch while he sipped from the establishment's trademark brew. His guest was running late, but given the enormous stakes for which the appointed successor of the Führer was playing, a few minutes give or take were mere trivialities. For the past month he had been on a blitz to wine and dine the upper crust of the Reich's society, using every bit of charisma and charm to win over the elites who would be able to bring considerable resources to bear in the event he needed it.\n\nAs Göring waited he continued to drink, and as he drank he allowed his mind to wander back to the past. Meeting Adolf, hosting the Alter Kampfer at Carin's insistence. The names of his old comrades flashed through his mind: Hitler, Rosenberg, Hess, even Röhm. Fucking Röhm. The degenerate pervert had gotten what was coming to him. That was long in the past however, and only was worth remembering as a testament to how fickle one's grip on authority and power could be. Whatever else might happen, Göring promised himself in that moment, he would never allow himself to end up as Röhm had. He would sooner drink a mug of poison then be humiliated in such a manner.\n\nThe slam of a door brought him out of his memories. He looked over to see the man he had been waiting for all night. He stood up to properly greet his guest and with a jovial smile he bellowed out:"
 goering_successor.13.a:0 ""Ah, Herr Bormann, how glad I am to see you!""
 
 goering_successor.14.t:0 "The Defector"
 goering_successor.14.d:0 "Nothing would ever be normal in the Reich again, the erupting Civil War had seen to that as sure as the sunrise. Still, even for the often ludicrous chaos that was now all too common across the globe, this was something else. Hermann Göring watched as the small military transport plane came in for a landing at the Kiel airport. Fighters and interceptors circled lazily in the sky, keeping the way safe for the small craft even in the capital of the provisional government that Göring had proclaimed following the death of Adolf Hitler. This VIP was too valuable to take any chances with.\n\nIt was Bormann. Not Martin of course; the conniving bastard was no doubt in Wien right now, hearing news of what Göring had pulled, shaking his fist impotently. No, this was Albert Bormann, the brother, who apparently had gotten any sense the family line had ever possessed. He had always displayed far more sense than Martin in supporting Göring's economic and military ambitions, and when Hitler had named Göring as his rightful successor, Albert had offered his services.\n\nHaving the brother of the man who was the biggest threat to his rule firmly within his camp was an utter coup, and the propaganda value was not lost on the would-be dictator. Even as he stood expectantly as the plane came to a smooth halt, the printers in every loyal city were churning out posters of Albert endorsing the rightful leader of the German people by the thousands. Göring smiled as he played out dozens of scenes of Martin's rage and consternation over and over again in his mind."

 goering_schoerner.1.desc:0 "Hermann Göring stared out of the window, swaying side to side. The grandiloquence of Germania was beginning to blur, the glorious white marble of the Volkshalle and black night sky running together like the colors of a painting. The phone was ringing. People were shouting. The distant gunshots were getting closer. Göring swirled his champagne glass with an empty smile and downed it in one gulp. What better time to celebrate than the end of the world?\n\nThe first phone call had been from an intelligence officer. Reichsmarschall Schörner and his loyal clique were sending men to seize government buildings throughout Germania, assassinating threats and cutting communication lines. The second phone call had been from a panicking Wilhelm Stuckart, who ranted for a few seconds before being dragged away with a cry.\n\nThe phone stopped ringing. He could hear men shouting outside the door. Visions flashed past him. Flying over France in the Great War. Meeting Carin for the first time. Delivering a speech before an adoring crowd. Marrying Emmy. Edda's birth. Planning the conquest of Europe. What was to become of Emmy? What was to become of Edda?\n\nLet the history books recall him as the Führer who went down fighting. The doors burst open, and a squadron of officers marched inside. Göring pulled out his Luger and fired aimlessly. The men fired back. Pain exploded across his belly, pushing his back against the desk and forcing him onto the floor with a gasp. Blood was pouring onto his hands, turning his gold wedding ring crimson, staining his beautiful uniform like red wine. Schörner stood above him, pointing a pistol directly at his head with a snarl. The bullet tore through the puppet's strings, and he lifelessly crumpled to the floor."

Their disgusting ideas creep into France, corrupting the people, corrupting the land itself! You, Führer, have been supplying us, and we thank you.

Should the Reich supply your loyal allies with additional weapons and arms, we shall be able to oust these traitors, those Italian dogs, and make France loyal to the Pakt once more.\n\nGöring stared at the letter. Yet another rebel group asking for guns, the French this time. To be honest, it was quite the irritation when the French sided with the Italians, in that Great Game of theirs. It would be quite the boon to the Pakt, the Reich, and National Socialism should the French be allied with the Einheitspakt once more. On the other hand, how loyal could these groups be? There was still much resentment from the French towards the Germans regarding their actions in the war. Additionally, it can't even be guaranteed if this coup of theirs would even succeed."

Firstly, almost nobody likes the Nazis in France. In what must be an utter shock to the Führer, genociding a nation makes the people there have a particular distaste for you. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the Germans just didn't send them enough guns. It takes a lot of support to overthrow a proper, stable, functioning government like our lovely friends in France, and the German aid just wasn't up to the task. This has added up to these armed forces "controlling" France to actually be a handful of fascists in fancy uniforms with some scary-looking guns walking around the street with no real ground-level control.\n\nBecause of this situation, we are in a prime position to take action.

The Nazi collaborationists were no proper army, barely even a militia, and they were cut down like wheat by a scythe when a proper trained military marched in. Bordeaux, Marseille, and the rest of the important cities were under the control of the Italian-backed government, and the Italian hegemony has returned to the French.\n\nThe police are now sweeping from door to door, searching for the traitors to the Italian state. This attempt at Nazi hegemony, while incredibly flimsy and doomed from the start, was an absolute terror to most of the inhabitants of France. Many were refugees from territory brutally occupied from the Reich, and everybody remembers the horrors of Burgundian-controlled France.\n\nFor once in their lives, police officers were cheered on as they dragged people out of apartments and put bullets in their heads.

Dens were found, raided, and those within were sometimes arrested, sometimes shot, but never escaped. News channels reported of the great success in the French state in resisting the German imperialism. Politicians spoke out against the coup, praising the success of the armed forces in keeping France free.

He kept on writing letters to the Germans, begging for guns, begging for support, saying that the cause was not lost. The requests were never answered, because, knowing it or not, Marcel was lying.

Letters separated from themselves, and then, with another rip dividing the letter into four pieces, became hardly readable.

That wasn't something you were supposed to just drink from for pity's sake. What was going on with the Führer? His old friend had gone clean years ago and yet, something had shaken that. Körner shuddered, afraid of what the answer was.\n\nBut back to the matter at hand. He had been called here to talk fortifications, and so on fortifications he would focus his thoughts. He quickly rescanned the proposal he had been brusquely handed as he had come in.

I thought the plan was to push into Burgundy, no?"\n\nGöring grimaced like a man in deep pain. For a moment he remained utterly silent and Körner felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. Then, with a furtive look around him as if to check to see if the two men were truly alone, the Führer bent in. His voice low and quiet, he began to speak, "Remer has been heading up the invasion and you know he is even less interested in my commands than Schörner is. In fact he doesn't even seem interested in listening to the Field Marshall anymore either. Serves him right. But I can't guarantee what will happen when the fighting begins.

Unfortunately, we believe that at the time of DIREWOLF's arrest, they were carrying sensitive documentation that may have exposed the operational norms of SIDEWINDER.

They are here, including Zongwu himself." Remer checked his suit in one of the window reflections one last time and then motioned his entourage to follow him. What looked like just any other warehouse had been quickly remodeled: Fancy chairs and a heavy conference table had replaced cargo holds, drinks and glasses were accurately distributed, expensive carpets and handmade lamps rounded off the picture. The Chinese had certainly tried to make the place presentable.\n\nAnd there in the middle stood the man he was here for, Gao Zongwu, president of the Chinese republic. A firm handshake later and Remer could finally start, what he had been here for: Get the Chinese to fight Japan, so German blood wouldn't have to be spilled. He didn't put it that way of course, but the other side wasn't stupid. They knew Göring, Schörner and company wanted pawns not allies.\n\nStill the meeting went somewhat pragmatic, but everyone knew and could almost feel the other's revulsion. But that didn't matter.

The two assembled groups could not be more disparate - the locals were swathed in loose white robes, the visitors already becoming uncomfortably damp in their grey and black woolen suits. The only aspect in common was their penchant for dark sunglasses. At an unspoken signal, the representatives broke from their packs and approached one another.\n\nReichsminister Artur Axmann responded to the "Assalaam 'alaikum" with a jumbled and stilted "Wa 'alaikum assalaam". With foreign pleasantries out of the way, he more confidently extended his hand and switched to German. "It is a pleasure to finally reach your great kingdom. Führer Göring extends the hand of friendship to King Faisal and all of the Arabian people."\n\nThe Arab diplomat nodded graciously. "And likewise, the King and all of his family send their best wishes to the Führer and his Reich. We trust your landing was not too rough - the King Abdulaziz International Airport is still under construction, but by its completion it will be the greatest airport in all Arabia."\n\nAxmann cast his gaze around. Indeed, it seemed as though the hand of god had lifted construction equipment from Germania itself and dropped it into the middle of the desert. The scale of construction was vast, sprawling into the edges of Jeddah itself. The town was expanding at the rate of knots - even from the air, one could see the pace of it's growth, spilling over its boundaries like a flood. Yes, the House of Saud could prove a valuable ally, if they could be appropriately wooed. He had his doubts about the Führer's choice not to use a show of force to cow the Sauds into submission, but he did as Göring thought best.

He had not time to appreciate the entirety of the great residence, however, as his duty as a diplomat called.\n\nThey now rested about a great table, waited upon with iced water, hot coffee and sweet fruits. Once Axmann's appetite had been sated, the Saudi delegation had begun to bring their terms to the table. "Herr Axmann," their leader, one Muhammad Abdullah ibn Saud said in a thick accent. "King Faisal has been most impressed by the Reich's success in its recent campaigns. The Saudi Kingdom's arms industry, while most effective, is small.

Some comment Axmann made caught Muhammad Abdullah's attention though, and he interjected. "Indeed, Germany's assertion of it's sphere of influence has been deeply impressive - however, the question of our own Kingdom's role in the area must be raised. While Persia is indeed a naturally Aryan domain, there exist states in the Persian Gulf, formerly under Italian dominion, that have long yearned for independence.

His hosts had certainly been generous, though he reminded himself not to be buttered up by their gifts.\n\nFor the final time they ate in that great conference room, plucking at fruits and idly chatting. Axmann was discussing the great scale of construction in Germania at length, though strategically failing to mention it's advanced decrepitude in the less desirable areas. Muhammad Abdullah laughed politely, and brought his own anecdote to the table, smoothly flowing into a request.\n\n"I do wish to one day see the great city of Germania, for its riches are told of across the globe. King Faisal too wishes to see Riyadh as a mighty capital for his kingdom, and Germania is seen by all as the model city. To celebrate the great friendship between our new nations, could the Reich make a gift to renovate the cities of Arabia in their image?""

The former Italian client state has realigned itself with the Reich, becoming an equal partner and avoiding the grim fate of its neighbours. With the treaty signed, there was an official exchange of gifts. To the Reich was presented a beautifully ornate scimitar, upon which was inscribed many blessings and prayers towards the Führer's health and wellbeing. To the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was gifted a great portrait of the Führer, signed with the hand of Göring himself. Axmann gave himself an internal pat on the back. He had endured great hardship; negotiated shrewdly; and in the end, he supposed, saved lives. Yes, this warranted a medal - though perhaps he would play up the hardship a bit. "

It has been a great pleasure to host you, but I am afraid our time must come to an end."\n\nAxmann cursed to himself. An end to negotiations meant an end to his stay, and an explanation for his failure to reach terms. Of course, there always remained the possibility of badmouthing his hosts - more like than not an invasion had been inevitable, he had always said so.\n\n"I thank you and King Faisal deeply for your hospitality, Mohammed Abdullah.

"Mein Führer, the Ringhorn plan is proceeding well, though there are some complications. To effectively maintain a cordon about Burgundy, a more effective network of bases is required. To rely solely on ports in Germany increases our ships' transit times to unacceptable levels. The ports of the Jade Bight and Denmark, while excellent, are simply too few, and many of our vessels must return to the Baltic to resupply. This creates gaps in our blockade, that -"\n\nGöring leaned forward in his chair, putting down his glass. "Gaps? My God man, this is unacceptable! You must rectify this at once!"\n\nThe Oberbefehlshaber was momentarily taken aback, but recovered quickly. "Indeed mein Führer. I believe that by requisitioning the ports of southern England and Norway, we could half the amount of time ships spend outside the cordon."\n\n"Then do so immediately. Damnation, it's like I have to decide everything here. Whatever it takes to bring down Burgundy, do it!"

The constant conquests of the Reich will inevitably reach the Co-Prosperity Sphere in a matter of months, and Russia will be the front line.\n\nThe Russians however are no more eager to take part in this conquest than we are to attempt to repel it. Whilst the All Russian Military League is nominally a collaborationist state, control over this vast area is weak and true collaborators are few and far between given Germany's reputation. The Reich considers them little more than cannon fodder at best and unworthy of life at worst. Messages have travelled across the steppe, carried by Russian and Mongolian horsemen, that suggest the League would be much happier working with Japan than Germany.\n\nTo steal Russia from under the Reich's nose would no doubt be considered an act of war, but war is all but inevitable. With Russian aid the front line would be much further from our own border, slowing the Reich's relentless advance and hopefully bogging them down in the Russian Hell once more."

It was the Führer of course, his thick fingers restlessly bouncing against the surface of the table over and over in an erratic rhythm. The veteran pilot noted that each digit was crowned with at least one jeweled ring. The value of the man's hands must have been worth more than an ME262. The 262; thinking about the jet had been a mistake. He felt himself once again in the cockpit, the sickening drop, the blinding flash. Then the fire, the awful flames that he could feel even now.\n\nIt took a supreme effort to regain his bearings. That was the past he reminded himself. That was the past and this is the present that must be focused on. If the corpuscular despot noticed the inner monologue, he didn't announce it. Instead, he gestured to a chair. Once the ace had seated himself comfortably, he plunged into the question that had been hanging above them this whole time.\n\n"My Führer, while I deeply appreciate the trust you seem to place in me, I am still unsure as to why you want me specifically to lead your Luftwaffe."\n\nTo his surprise, Führer Göring smiled, "Ah straight down to business, eh? I like that in a subordinate you know. Always good to get right to the important parts and leave small talk for later, yes that's just what I require."\n\nHe began to say something else, but stopped himself, looking to Steinhoff as if he might be nervous about something.\n\n"The truth is General Steinhoff..." he was quieter now, almost conspiratorial, "the truth is that I need someone who isn't beholden to either the butcher or the pissant by my side."\n\nSchörner and Speidel - the realization dawned on Johannes, the Führer was apparently not fond of his top officers it seemed.\n\n"It will be a tall task no doubt, but I offer to spare no expense for my Luftwaffe you understand. Anything you want, you'll have no questions asked. Nominally of course you'll have to report to Generalfeldmarschall Schörner at OKW really you'll be answerable to me and me alone.

 goering.1704.t:0 "The Pencil Pushing Admiral"
 goering.1704.d:0 ""So, what do you think, Admiral Puttkamer?" The Führer studied the face of his guest, looking for a hint of the demanded decision. As usual, Puttkamer kept his poker face. Or maybe it was just indifference? In all their years together the old Reichsmarschall had never been able to parse out how much of the inscrutability Adolf's old adjutant exuded was a matter of personal policy or as simple disinterest. He briefly wondered if he had born a similar expression in those days when he had taken to the morphine needle. No, he decided after a little thought, even in the worst of his stupor he had always had the flame of ambition and the will to carry it forward. Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer was nothing like him.\n\nSo why then was he giving such a man the reins of the Kriegsmarine? Rather, what was left of the Kriegsmarine following the defections and the blow of Dönitz's mutiny anyhow. Göring could have given a dozen public-ready answers at that moment: the man had served Adolf impeccably, he had a long and distinguished career, on and on. The truth however was far simpler. The man had no ambition whatsoever. Even the humblest of clerks in the Reich's government knew that the new Führer was, to put it politely, not very interested in the functioning of the navy. That meant it was best left to someone else to manage, and better a man with little desire to abuse his authority than one hungry for more power. Never another Dönitz, that was Göring's sole criteria when he began his search, and it was the criteria he followed when he landed on Puttkamer.\n\n"I just want to remind you," the heavy-set dictator said softly, noticing the lack of response to the ultimate question, "that I do not intend to bother you on your duties. Nor will General Schörner be given free reign either. You will of course report to him, but that doesn't mean he has any more desire to manage your affairs than I do. Frankly, I'd consider it a great favor for you to remove the navy from all this factional bickering once and for all."\n\nPuttkamer nodded slowly, almost... thoughtfully.\n\nThat was all Göring needed, an acceptance, whether Puttkamer had realized it or not. With profuse thanks he escorted his new Grossadmiral to the door. For his part, Puttkamer put up no resistance, seemingly consigned to his new role. Good, Göring thought as he closed the door to his office, he hated when things were made difficult."

Hours of this damnable stalemate was making him frustrated and irritable. Not for the first time he considered directly ordering Speidel to assume control of OKH, but then that would have to be an absolute last resort. He needed the general to agree to take the position and needed him to, if not enjoy his place in the new regime, be a check against Schörner.\n\nSpeidel must have thought that ended it, he began to rise from his chair. That made Göring snap, "Damnit general, do you not understand the stakes at play here? Do you think this is all about personal pride and pleasure? It isn't!"\n\nSpeidel's annoyance was written across his face. He clearly resented this lecture. Göring knew he had to make an all or nothing attempt if he wanted to salvage the situation.\n\n"Listen general, if you wish to serve the Reich and its people in the most effective way, then you must accept. Do you wish to see the entire Wehrmacht in the hands of Schörner? I certainly don't but it seems you do, if you'd simply walk away at this opportunity to limit his influence. Accept, and we can work together to make sure he isn't the only voice in my ear."\n\nThat got Speidel to stop. He responded slowly, thoughtfully, "If I were to accept, and that's only an if at this point, I would need some guarantees of non-interference from Schörner if the goal is to actually be effective in my position-. Would that be possible?"\n\nThe Führer smiled; he had Speidel hooked. "I can't guarantee a miracle but I should be able to wring out some concessions for your autonomy."\n\nSpeidel sighed, nodded, "The things we do for the Reich...""

Right now I need to ask both of you," he motioned for Albert to join the conversation, "to prove your loyalty to me."\n\nAlbert, always trying to make up for his familial shame, was predictably quick to respond, "Of course my, Führer, whatever it is you need we will provide. I swear we are both your devoted servants."\n\nTheodore lamely nodded along, never one for having much in the way of independent thought. That would actually help in this case however.\n\n"My friends, the Reich is at a crossroads. We may have triumphed in the civil war but I must still contend with the Wehrmacht. They believe I owe my position to their efforts alone! Knowing that tenacious bastard Schörner, they will never let me forget it. That's where you two come in.

"Schörner may cut your checks and take credit for your work, but as long as I am Führer, you report to me first. Is that understood?"

No one deserved such a fate.\n\nThe conveyor belt sent more half-assembled grenades his way, waiting for final assembly. It was then that the idea came to him. It was a foolish, brazen idea. But Jon had always been a daredevil in his youth. It was the memories of those days in the streets of Lublin, getting into mischief with tinkering with the watches in his father's shop that drove him forward. A modification here, an adjustment there, and the grenades would detonate much sooner. With any luck, they'd take whatever Nazi bastard was throwing them to Hell.\n\nThey had made the factories to be as efficiently possible, producing as much material as they could wring out through slave labor. For the first time since being sent to the damned place, Jon was happy about that fact. He was producing the defective explosives at a truly prodigious rate. Even the foreman seemed impressed, granting him an extra hour of rest for his efforts. Jon almost laughed out loud, but kept his composure and facade of submission.\n\nJon had long ago abandoned his faith, but he prayed to God now, for the nations of the world.

The fruits of that project are evident in the officials that make up every level of our Reich's administration, army, and even clergy. The first Hitler Youth was, regrettably, largely destroyed in the crucible of the Civil War, divided as it was between the vying contenders. Now that Göring has established himself as the new Führer however, work has begun on the recreation of this useful organization, rebranded of course as the Göring Youth. A new generation of Germans will be brought up learning to love and respect their leader, and this time, they will not be allowed to become fifth columnists and traitors."

In fact, they seem to have shown their displeasure by ransacking as much of our tools of administration, records, and files as they could get their hands on before evacuating from Africa. Our mission here is one of cleansing, not bookkeeping, but unfortunately for us the former will be far less efficient without the latter. The damage done is significant, but at least not irreversible. We will have to put substantial resources into documentation if we have any hope of making up the gap at any rate."

We have given them so much since we took them under our wing: safety, security, prosperity, and we even promised them eventual integration into the glorious Reich. It was not enough for them it seems, or perhaps they were led astray by the Judeo-Bolsheviks that still fester in the dark. We shall shine a light that will burn them out with its intensity."
Goering_ostland_category_anarchy:0 "Operation Ostwind"
Goering_ostland_category_anarchy_desc:0 "The Ostland Civil War has continued to rage on even as the fires of our own conflict have faded.

Goering_ostland_category_kovner:0 "Operation Ostwind"
Goering_ostland_category_kovner_desc:0 "The worst has come to past in Ostland. Abba Kovner, the madman who leads the United Partisan Organization.

Goering_ostland_category_landrut:0 "Operation Ostwind"
Goering_ostland_category_landrut_desc:0 "Meyer-Landrut believes he is the saviour of the Baltic? Hah, an amusing joke, but no more.

Landrut shall see just how we treat fools and lunatics in the new Reich."
Goering_ostland_category_anarchy2:0 "Operation Ostwind"
Goering_ostland_category_anarchy2_desc:0 "The Ostland Civil War has continued to rage on even as the fires of our own conflict have faded.

It is clear that we must ride to our ally's aid, but what to do after that remains up in the air."

Goering_ostland_category_jeckeln_desc:0 "The SS have won in Ostland it seems, but Herr Jeckeln and his master in Burgundy will not have long to celebrate if we have any say. As far as we are concnerned, the SS, even formations outside of Germany, are part of a traitorous organization that is more loyal to the dead dog Heydrich and Himmler than to the Führer. We will not allow a redoubt of sedition to fester on our border!"
Goering_ostland_category_vituska:0 "Operation Ostwind"
Goering_ostland_category_vituska_desc:0 "Michał Vituška is certainly a strange case of all the contenders who fought in Ostland. While he was a seemingly loyal collaborator for decades, it remains true that he is not an Aryan and he fought against our people in Ostland. We would be best served by crushing such treason with swift brutality. On the other hand, a man willing to collaborate before might do so again..."
Goering_ostland_category_drechsler:0 "Operation Ostwind"
Goering_ostland_category_drechsler_desc:0 "The chaos in Ostland seems to have subsided and as luck would have it our man Otto-Heinrich Drechsler has come out on top. This has caused a great deal of celebration in the Wehrmacht and indeed it does seem as if Ostland will rejoin the Reich sooner than expected. Still, Drechsler is the militarists' man, not necessarily the Führer's. Perhaps it would be better to incur the wrath of Schörner today in order to deprive him of a pawn in the future..."
Goering_ostland_category_stahlecker:0 "Operation Ostwind"
Goering_ostland_category_stahlecker_desc:0 "The winner in Ostland is Franz Walter Stahlecker, a capable man for all accounts, but unfortunately not a militarist like Dreschsler. Indeed, the Wehrmacht is postively frothing to strike at the former colony, demanding blood for the defeat of their man. However, it is not they who rule in the Reich as long as Göring is alive. Whether to work with or destroy Stahlecker, the choice is the Führer's alone."
