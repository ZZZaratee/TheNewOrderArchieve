 ##### EVENTS #####
 WORLD.2.t:0 "Adolf Hitler Has Died"
 WORLD.2.d:0 "Tragedy has consumed Germany as the news spread first throughout the Reich and then the world. Adolf Hitler, Führer of Germany and victor of the Second World War, has died. Whilst the Führer's declining health had been speculated about for some time, the news has nevertheless left Germany in a state of complete shock. The Reichstag has announced that three months of mourning shall be held, and that the Führer shall be buried beside his late wife, Eva Hitler, with dignitaries from around the world invited to the funeral.\n\nWhile Germany mourns, internationally many are celebrating the death of the man held responsible for three decades of suffering throughout the world. Yet many international commentators fear what may now become of Germany, the Third Reich having already been embattled in a bitter power struggle over the rightful successor to the Führership."
 WORLD.2.a:0 "A day to remember..."

 WORLD.5.t:0 "The German Civil War"
 WORLD.5.d:0 "In the wake of Adolf Hitler's death, the Reich has erupted into chaos. Despite the Führer's appointment of a legal successor, powerful factions within the Reich have taken up arms against one another with the interest of leading the nation in their vision. The nation is torn with entire garrisons ignoring orders from Germania and flocking to the successor of their choice. Though the gravity of the situation is not yet known, it is estimated that the Reich is either facing or already experiencing total collapse of central authority.\n\nThough not much is known about the fate of the Reich's eastern administrations, the sudden cessation of contact between Germania and her possessions has created speculation on if those regions too will find their fate. What is known for sure, however, is that the collapse of Europe's titan has thrown the continent asunder."
 WORLD.5.a:0 "The end of the Reich, surely."

 WORLD.11.t:0 "The Reich's Last Conquest"
 WORLD.11.desc:0 "On the 19th of January, 1962, Eberhard Köllner became the first man to ever land on the Moon. While the space race has been a struggle between the Reich, Japan and the USA, and while the Americans had managed to put the first man in space, the Führer was proud to announce that the German landing firmly plants the Reich as the victor in the competition.\n\nA grand ceremony is planned in Germania to present Köllner and his fellow astronauts with the Iron Cross, and a week of celebration has been declared across the Reich.\n\nWhile terse congratulations have been sent from America and Japan, President Nixon has vowed that the United States would be the first to create a permanent mission on the Moon, and Japan shortly thereafter announced it would be the first to land on Mars."
 WORLD.11.a:0 "Has the Space Race been won?"

 WORLD.20.t:0 "The Collapse of the Triumvirate"
 WORLD.20.d:0 "In the wake of the bombing of the Triumvirate conference in Malta, it would appear as though whatever chances the fragile alliance had went down in the flames. The incident proving to be the final straw for many, both the caudillos and the Turkish president have now declared their respective countries' desire to leave the alliance. With two of the alliance's three major powers leaving, it is safe to say that the days of the Triumvirate are over.\n\nAlready Turkey has made fresh calls for its territorial rights and ambitions in the region to be respected, particularly in regard to Cyprus and the Levant, with the Italian military being mobilized in response to Turkish movements in Syria. On their part, the Iberians have expressed little desire to keep up significant relations with their former allies, Iberia instead looking inwards toward its own problems."
 WORLD.20.a:0 "It was only a matter of time."

 WORLD.23.t:0 "Expansion Into Africa"
 WORLD.23.d:0 "West Africa has had it rough since the end of the Second World War. Luftwaffe units based out of the Reich's holdings in Central Africa have, for the past two decades, bombed anything inland into dust.\n\nWith the death of Hitler and the collapse of the Reich, those Luftwaffe units haven't moved in a long time. Already, several small nations on the coast have begun expanding their borders inland, free from the fear of constant German bombing. Whether the bombing resumes or not, only time will tell."
 WORLD.23.a:0 "Interesting."

 WORLD.28.t:0 "The Anti-Heydrich Pact Forms"
 WORLD.28.desc:0 "The German Civil War has taken many twists and turns, but this may be the strangest of them all. Earlier today, multiple contenders to the Führership have announced a temporary ceasefire between them in order to focus on what they have deemed "the largest threat to the Reich today" - Reinhard Heydrich and his SS.\n\nHeydrich and the SS, backed only by Heinrich Himmler, have made surprising gains in recent months despite their poor starting position and lack of political power or popular appeal. It appears that this has spooked the other contenders, whose forces now gather to put an end to Heydrich's armies. With Heydrich being a proud follower of both Himmler and his 'Burgundian system', it must be a relief to Germans everywhere that their leaders can at least agree on one thing - mutual hatred of the SS and what it stands for."
 WORLD.28.a:0 "Himmler's madness will not spread to our soil!"
 WORLD.28.b:0 "Let them come."
 WORLD.28.c:0 "Heydrich will handle this with ease."
 WORLD.28.d:0 "It could always be worse."

 WORLD.34.t:0 "Assassin Strikes at Hitler!"
 WORLD.34.desc:0 "News from Germany is sporadic at best. Information smuggled out of Germania reports that shortly after celebrations over the Moon landing settled, military units and several platoons worth of bodyguard units filled the streets and immediately put the city under martial law. Apparently, an assassin, which the Germans claim belonged to the Japanese Kenpeitai, attempted to kill the Führer, but was stopped in his attempt by one of Hitler's personal bodyguards.\n\nAlready, reports of various other assassinations have surfaced. In the streets, the various military units nearly came to blows, as several units ordered each other to stand down and the chain of command fell apart. Suddenly, the Reich seems much weaker. Can the Germans maintain their New World Order when they can hardly handle themselves?"
 WORLD.34.a:0 "A house divided..."
 WORLD.34.b:0 "Oh no."
 WORLD.34.c:0 "What is this the meaning of this insolent accusation?"

 WORLD.35.t:0 "The South African War"
 WORLD.35.desc:0 "Violence erupted across South Africa today as the Boer Republic, angered at what they have perceived as endless attacks on themselves by the South African government, formally declared its independence from the Republic of South Africa.\n\nAccompanying the declaration Boer militias, carrying mostly German armaments, have spread out across the Orange Free State and numerous other parts of Northwestern South Africa, coming into armed conflict with South African soldiers stationed in the area.\n\nAs the conflict continues to escalate, it is currently unknown what exactly the German response will be. Yet as observers report increasing militarization of the South African border by the newly formed Afrika-Schild, many consider the German response to be self-evident."
 WORLD.35.a:0 "For freedom!"
 WORLD.35.b:0 "A perfect opportunity..."
 WORLD.35.c:0 "They'll doom us all!"
 WORLD.35.d:0 "Africa in chaos. Typical."

 WORLD.36.t:0 "Afrika-Schild Intervenes In South Africa"
 WORLD.36.desc:0 "As the Boer rebellion rages on, international journalists on the ground are reporting that German colonial panzer divisions have now begun to pour across the South African border in a rapid escalation of the conflict. Forces of the newly formed 'Afrika-Schild' have already won several key victories, forcing already stretched thin South African soldiers into retreating south in disarray.\n\nWith the OFN having expressed support for the South African regime for almost a decade, the feeling on the ground was captured by quickly spreading footage of a battle-bloody South African soldier, part of a convoy of soldiers retreating to Port Nolloth, who asked the cameras the question that many have been asking:\n\n"Where the fuck are the Yankees?""
 WORLD.36.a:0 "Truest allies!"
 WORLD.36.b:0 "True glory shall be had!"
 WORLD.36.c:0 "True snakes!"
 WORLD.36.d:0 "True chaos! When will it end?"

 WORLD.37.t:0 "The Franco-Burgundian War"
 WORLD.37.desc:0 "As the situation within Europe rapidly develops as the German sphere free falls into total collapse, many have wondered what if any move the secretive 'black state' would make. With recently leaked footage from Germany showing SS convoys moving into Burgundy, a border that has become one of the most militarized on Earth overnight, many observers declared this to be evidence that Heinrich Himmler had withdrawn support of Reinhard Heydrich's claim for the Führership.\n\nYet the true reasoning has now revealed itself. While the international community is still scrambling to make sense of the chaos, Burgundian tanks are now rolling into Paris and the French military, severely weakened by German sanctions, have either been forced into full retreat or had entire divisions destroyed wherever they dare make their stands."
 WORLD.37.a:0 "God save us!"
 WORLD.37.b:0 "They shall know power."
 WORLD.37.c:0 "A shadow looms over France..."

 WORLD.38.t:0 "A Well-Advised War"
 WORLD.38.desc:0 "The first American 'advisors' landed in South Africa today as part of a joint task-force between the United States Marines and Army under the Military Assistance Advisory Group, or MAAG. Led by the newly promoted General Paul D. Harkins, the MAAG is ostensibly only advisors to train and prepare South African soldiers to assist them in their battle against the encroaching RKs, with the U.S. government claiming they are not fighting the war, merely "aiding a fellow free nation in their darkest hour".\n\nThis has raised many eyebrows, especially as U.S. bombers off of the USS Saratoga and Essex have already began pummeling German positions and U.S. military members have been photographed alongside their South African counterparts in heavy fighting. Whether as part of an 'Advisory Group' or as part of an army, the United States has now joined the South African War. Time will tell if the rest of the OFN shall follow..."
 WORLD.38.a:0 "Those dogs!"
 WORLD.38.b:0 "Send a formal complaint immediately!"
 WORLD.38.c:0 "Our friends at last!"
 WORLD.38.d:0 "Let's rock and roll!"
 WORLD.38.e:0 "American adventurism in Africa? Who would have thought."

 WORLD.39.t:0 "The OFN Agrees!"
 WORLD.39.desc:0 "In perhaps unsurprising news, the OFN has agreed to join America in the ongoing struggle in South Africa. With enough votes to push the organization into the war, the allied nations of the United States have already began landing in South African ports, flying over Boer skies and fighting across the rugged battlefields of Africa. This news has been celebrated by the United States who has proclaimed that the OFN has proven that it is dedicated to the safety and protection of all free people of the world, with politicians and generals both decrying those who have accused the OFN of being a do-nothing organization. It remains to be seen how useful this will be to South Africa, though the South African military is reportedly pleased."
 WORLD.39.a:0 "Fools! All of them!"
 WORLD.39.b:0 "How dare they gang up on us!? We're innocent!"
 WORLD.39.c:0 "By our powers combined!"
 WORLD.39.d:0 "We never had any doubt."
 WORLD.39.e:0 "All for one, and one for all!"
 WORLD.39.f:0 "Will this chaos ever end!?"

 WORLD.40.t:0 "The OFN Protests!"
 WORLD.40.desc:0 "In shocking news, the U.S. war conference with the rest of the OFN has fallen apart into infighting. After numerous votes against, the diplomats from the United States called off the vote and reportedly stormed from the meeting chambers. While U.S. allies in the OFN are berating their fellow members of the organization for "sabotaging the integrity of the great institution", they can do little to truly force these nations to participate and what's being increasingly called an 'American war'. The United States has stated it will not let petty politics stop its now surely damaged mission to South Africa, and that it and its true allies would be joining the war regardless of what anyone may think. One thing is for certain however, the reputation of the OFN is surely tarnished."
 WORLD.40.a:0 "The international community speaks for freedom!"
 WORLD.40.b:0 "They fear our might!"
 WORLD.40.c:0 "What!? Are you kidding me!?"
 WORLD.40.d:0 "What a bunch of idiots."
 WORLD.40.e:0 "A house divided..."
 WORLD.40.f:0 "An eagle without talons, it seems."

 WORLD.41.t:0 "The Third Battle of London"
 WORLD.41.desc:0 "Chaos in the streets of London! American reporters were, as always, the first to break the news while the international community has struggled to play catchup with the shocking news of violence spreading across England. It seems that while chaos reigns on the mainland, the British resistance has decided to make their move.\n\nPerhaps most shocking is their leader. Claude Auchinleck, former British general in charge of defending the isles during the German invasion, now leads a coalition of resistance groups across the nation in rebellion against the Germans. Auchinleck had been a quiet, diminutive card carrying member of the nation's Royal Party, but now leads his men in full military uniform in battle against the German garrison and the local collaborators. He proclaims, alongside his allies from a dozen different ideologies of twice that many resistance groups, that England shall be free again... or that they shall all die as free men."
 WORLD.41.a:0 "Britannia shall rise anew!"
 WORLD.41.b:0 "Chaos! Chaos everywhere!"
 WORLD.41.c:0 "What the hell!?"
 WORLD.41.d:0 "Rise, brothers! Rise!"
 WORLD.41.e:0 "The isles burn anew!"

 WORLD.42.t:0 "A Lullaby to Britannia"
 WORLD.42.desc:0 "The Germans breath a sigh of relief, the Americans and the OFN curse in dismay, and the English once more find themselves shackled under the collaborators. Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance and the many resistance cells it contained have been destroyed by the English government, those few survivors finding themselves captured or routed to Wales and Scotland where they will no doubt harass the English for years to come. The coalition of resistance forces is dead, and Auchinleck himself has disappeared. What exactly has become of the leader is unknown.\n\nThe rebellion, the final one for the English many believe, is over, a last cry of freedom harshly beaten down, a final flickering flame hushed out in the dead of night.\n\nWith the resistance destroyed, the English government now moves to rebuild the nation and look to the future. Many, however, question if England might be irrevocably changed. Will the Germans still trust the English to handle their own affairs? And will the English still bow to German whims after this show of defiance?"
 WORLD.42.a:0 "We look to a better future."
 WORLD.42.b:0 "A great sign to partisans across Europe!"
 WORLD.42.c:0 "We will return lads. One day."
 WORLD.42.d:0 "A reminder of the strength of tyranny."

 WORLD.43.t:0 "An Ode to Britannia!"
 WORLD.43.desc:0 "English soldiers tear off their patches and flags and help cheering civilians raise flags of the now free England and the long-dead United Kingdom aloft across London and across the nation. Civilians roam the streets in Cornwall free from fear for the first time in decades, children laughing and pelting refuse on the long columns of German POWs being escorted to holding camps across the nation. Pubs across England proudly declare that all drinks are free to the brave members of HMMLR and the united British resistance of Wales, Cornwall and England. This of course means that drinks are free to all, the already blurry line of who constitutes a member of these shadowy cells becoming blurrier under the powers of strong drink, proud song and boisterous celebration.\n\nFrom the steps of the now liberated Westminster with his rapidly assembled cabinet, Auchinleck has declared himself defense secretary and declared a brief period of martial law until the new government can be formed and England restored to order. Until then however, the streets are owned by the people, and their raucous celebrations."
 WORLD.43.a:0 "We look to a better future."
 WORLD.43.b:0 "Damnation! Insanity! Pure insanity!"
 WORLD.43.c:0 "Three cheers for our comrades in the homeland!"
 WORLD.43.d:0 "On English neck, no boot sits."

 WORLD.47.t:0 "Hans Speidel Assumes Control of Germania"
 WORLD.47.desc:0 "With Germany having collapsed into civil war across the country, even at this early state of the conflict the toll both in terms of lives and destruction is rapidly becoming apparent. Yet it appears as though not everyone within the Reich is interested in taking part in this destructive war. In light of the collapse of the emergency council, Field Marshal Hans Speidel, best known for foiling the attempted SS coup during the West Russian War, today marched into Germania.\n\nOn the steps of the Reichstag, with respected war hero Field Marshal Erwin Rommel beside him, Speidel declared his neutrality in the conflict. The city of Germania will now be garrisoned by the forces of Speidel, Rommel and other generals loyal to their cause of neutrality, with a stern warning of an unshakable resistance should any side in the civil war attempt to attack the city."
 WORLD.47.a:0 "The hero we needed."
 WORLD.47.b:0 "More trouble in Germany."

 WORLD.48.t:0 "Formation of the Afrika-Schild"
 WORLD.48.desc:0 "With Germany still consumed by the chaos of civil war and many of its territories becoming plagued with conflicts of their own, German Africa has today announced its intention to weather this terrible storm. Whilst the three German African colonies have previously only enacted cordial yet basic relations with each other, a joint declaration from Siegfried Müller, Wolfgang Schenck and Hans Hüttig has announced the creation of Afrika-Schild.\n\nOfficially an alliance only defensive in purpose in order to ensure stability within the colonies, many international observers have expressed concern about what the alliances true intentions in Africa may be. Whilst the OFN has condemned the "immoral, colonial alliance", many within the German sphere have praised Müller in particular for his dedication to protecting German interests and personnel across the continent."
 WORLD.48.a:0 "We stand together."
 WORLD.48.b:0 "A worrying development."

 WORLD.66.t:0 "The English Civil War"
 WORLD.66.d:0 "As the German Civil War and its proxy conflicts tear apart Europe, the fires have seemingly spread to England.\n\nClaude Auchinleck, famous for being general to surrender during the German invasion and having spent the last ten years as a seemingly proud member of the collaborator regime, has declared a free England and revealed himself as the previously mysterious leader of the united English resistance group, Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance. Already, partisan brigades from resistance cells, including Bill Alexander's Communist Front which had allied with HMMLR previously in the year, have taken much from the collaborators. The garrison in Cornwall have already begun rolling into England proper, but the scale of this uprising is unprecedented, even with two large scale uprisings in the past."
 WORLD.66.a:0 "Will England finally be free?"

 WORLD.67.t:0 "Collapse of German Madagaskar"
 WORLD.67.d:0 "Admiral Thomas Moorer of the OFN's Indian Ocean Command affirms that the situation in German Madagascar had reached a stage of open rebellion against the government of Reichskommissar Emil Maurice. Although Madagaskar, much like other German territories, is plagued by the issue of native resistance to colonial rule, Moorer confidently announced that it was the German garrison which mutinied. Earlier reports also confirmed that the native Malagasy of the island had subsequently taken up arms.\n\nNo comment on the uprising was forthcoming from Germania, with unofficial reports indicating a general indifference about the island's fate. Experts agree that, with political instability regarding the succession of Adolf Hitler, the island, often used by the Reich to exile those who have fallen out of favor, is unlikely to receive much attention there.\n"
 WORLD.67.a:0 "The everlasting legacy of the Reich."

 WORLD.68.t:0 "Freedom for Angola?"
 WORLD.68.d:0 "As the South African War continues to envelop the entire Southern African continent, a baffling report has come back from the capital of Südwestafrika: early in the day, half a dozen of Luftwaffe transports planes took off heading to a destination unknown, amongst its passengers Reichskommissar Wolfgang Schenck, his closest aides, and their families.\n\nIn an even more shocking turn of events, the Reichskommissar's private doctor, Jonas Savimbi, proceeded to make a speech on Radio Luanda hours after the plane left, declaring himself president of an independent Angola, and calling his citizens to take up arms and defend the newborn nation. Thousands of Ovimbundu militiamen, alongside native SS units stationed at the rear have already pledged allegiance to the new president, with fighting between them and their former Schild allies already erupting across Angola."
 WORLD.68.a:0 "Wait, what?"
 
 WORLD.70.t:0 "The End of the Missile Crisis"
 WORLD.70.d:0 "The event that has kept the world sitting on the edge of its seat for several months has thankfully finally come to an end today as the United States and Japan have reached agreement over the Hawaiian Missile Crisis.\n\nWhile the USN 1st Fleet and the IJN have been in standoff around Hawaii for months now, Vice President Kennedy and Prime Minister Ino have agreed that Japan will withdraw its ballistic missiles (discovered by a CIA U-2C spy plane) from the disputed islands, while the United States would remove its own MRBMs from Australia.\n\nThis has been a massive diplomatic coup for Vice President Kennedy, who negotiated the deal, while world press has largely criticized Nixon for his lack of action in the negotiations."
 WORLD.70.a:0 "We've staved off midnight, for now."

 WORLD.71.t:0 "Twilight of Civilization"
 WORLD.71.desc:0 "Washington D.C., Germania and Tokyo sit in rubble, nuclear fire having scorched them from this Earth in a matter of moments. Across the world, power stations fail, clouds of ash blot out the sun, and astronauts from various nations watch as the lights blink out one by one like dying stars.\n\nThe world is silent, as the final struggle comes to a close. Without commanders, the armies no longer fight, without a port, the navies drift at sea, and without a home, refugees cover the landscape, tearing apart what few nations were not directly brought down by the devastation of nuclear warfare.\n\nWell over half a billion are dead from this great, and possibly last, conflict, and those few experts remaining expect the number to triple in the aftermath, if not worse."
 WORLD.71.a:0 "By God, what have we done?"

 WORLD.104.t:0 "Gods of the North"
 WORLD.104.desc:0 "Reports have slowly begun filtering down from movement in the distant communes of Siberia. What it is, really, we can not say, but the fact that any form of news is leaving that region alone has set many to wondering what exactly could be happening. Surely, if the communes are making any kind of stir for the first time in twenty years, it must be in some form important.\n\nReports speak of stirrings from the religious. Those few traders who make their way that far north over the East Siberian trade routes have spoken of entire communes chanting in prayer, of churches being filled to the brim, and of some figure pushing them onward. Nobody knows exactly what has spurred this action, but the people of Siberia keep praying for one man.\n\nThey call him, the Father.\n"
 WORLD.104.a:0 "Nothing but nonsense."

 WORLD.200.t:0 "Mordrel Secures Breton Leadership"
 WORLD.200.d:0 "After reports of increased tensions between the various political forces within Brittany in the wake of the German Civil War, the situation appears to have calmed down. International observers are confirming reports that Olier Mordrel's crackdown on his opponents has resulted in successful counter against the upheaval. Both the extremist wings of the SBB and the democratic hopefuls of the SAV have been, for the time being, silenced.\n\nAs Mordrel is well into his third decade of heading the Breton National Committee, experts everywhere wonder if things will remain as they have since the Congress of Pontivy in 1940, or if Mordrel is finally ready to make his plans a reality."
 WORLD.200.a:0 "How is this news?"
 
 WORLD.201.t:0 "Delaporte Overthrows Breton Government"
 WORLD.201.d:0 "Startling news from Brest, as observers are reporting a democratic takeover of Brittany. Practically a fascist dictatorship since the fall of France, Brittany nevertheless was ruled by the Breton National Committee, from which the democratic forces of the SAV have evidently emerged from.\n\nLead by a man named Raymond Delaporte, the nearly bloodless revolution in Brittany has sent Olier Mordrel into exile, and his henchman Célestin Lainé has been arrested by military forces loyal to Delaporte.\n\nAs a small and democratic nation in Europe, Brittany will certainly face trouble from its neighboring countries, especially Himmler's Burgundian state."
 WORLD.201.a:0 "A new democracy in Europe?"

 WORLD.203.t:0 "Lainé Takes Over Breton Government"
 WORLD.203.d:0 "The international community has finally pieced together the frantic reports coming from Brittany: the national socialist faction of the SBB, lead by Célestin Lainé, has taken control of the nation.\n\nNumerous deaths of the opponents of the Bezen Perrot, which some have called Lainé's personal army, have been reported. Among the casualties is Olier Mordrel, the previous leader of the Breton National Committee, whose cause of death is as of yet unknown.\n\nWith full control of the state, experts fear the bloodshed in Brittany has only begun. A few experts are even preparing for the worst, as Lainé is believed to have connections to Heinrich Himmler's Burgundy."
 WORLD.203.a:0 "Bloody times for Brittany."
 
 WORLD.204.t:0 "Breton Black Market Shut Down"
 WORLD.204.d:0 "In an internationally divisive statement, Raymond Delaporte of Brittany has announced that the infamous Breton black market will be shut down. Something of a public secret, the involvement of the Bretons in the international black market has been known for a long time, but to many, the extent of their operations has come as a shock.\n\nIn his statement, Delaporte takes full responsibility for the suffering the "misguided" practice has brought on the world, and promises to take steps towards redemption. However, scattered reports are already coming in of Breton operatives going rogue in the wake of the news that threatens their livelihood."
 WORLD.204.a:0 "Where are we going to get our guns from now?"
 WORLD.204.b:0 "Good riddance."
 WORLD.204.c:0 "It had to be done."

 WORLD.340.t:0 "The Warsaw Uprising"
 WORLD.340.d:0 "While the Generalgouvernement in Poland has always been quiet, this has seemingly been little more than a thin veneer, desperately kept on by the Germans in the face of growing unrest. This has become evident when, not even weeks after the beginning of the German Civil War, the Polish Home Army, or the AK, has begun a general uprising that has easily toppled the weak Generalgouvernement and its leader, Hans Frank.\n\nWith a free Poland on the very border of the Reich, the future seems unclear for how well the rest of the German sphere will weather this storm. Still, Poland is completely surrounded by the Reich on all borders besides the southern front, where it has some scant access to its rapidly collapsing neighbor in Hungary. One can only guess at the reborn state's future."

 WORLD.341.d:0 "Since the death of Benito Mussolini, the first duce of Italy and creator of fascism, Italy's commitment to fascism has been fading. And for that today, 1 June 1963, is a historical day for Italy and her people, the winds of change are blowing as the Congress in Verona has been assembled to determine the future direction of Italian Empire.\n\nWhat this direction will be is bound to the conference; the arguments will be made, agreements will be reached, tensions will rise, hostilities will be soften and eventually a pathway for Italian people will be reached. As Duce Ciano makes his opening speech, international observers listen in excitement as one of the largest colonial empires of the world may loosen her iron grip over her subjects and people, or not. The Verona Conference will decide her fate."
 WORLD.341.a:0 "Interesting."

 WORLD.342.d:0 "Today, Verona Conference, the assembly gathered together to determine the future direction of Italian Empire, has come to an end. As Duce Ciano made his closing speech to the congress, it seems after so much heated debating and furious arguing, majority of the congress come to an agreement with Ciano, approving his mandate. Roaring masses of people are celebrating in the streets from Verona itself to Sicily, church bells are ringing, choirs are singing as the long anticipated reforms are in the way now, all thanks to Duce Ciano!\n\nNot everybody is happy with this result of course. Carlo Scorza, the political rival of Ciano, left the congress room in frustration during duce's closing speech, reports are coming all around Italy about Black Brigade violence and street fights with celebrating people. Yet, the path is now clear for Italy and her people, they only need to follow it.\n"

 WORLD.343.d:0 "Today, the Verona Conference, the assembly gathered together to determine the future direction of Italian Empire, has come to an end. As Duce Ciano made a half-hearted closing speech, it seems majority of the congress seem to be in an agreement with Carlo Scorza, a renown traditional fascist and political rival of Ciano. His supporters all around the empire are rallying in the city squares, showing their support for Scorza and his ideas to make the empire strong once again!\n\nNot everybody is happy with this result of course, Duce Ciano himself is clearly disappointed with the result, as his mandate is denied and his power as duce have been questioned by Scorza, more so people that were anticipating for reforms to the empire have to protest even now. Yet, the path is now clear for Italy and her people, they only need to follow it."
 WORLD.343.a:0 "An interesting development from Italy."

 WORLD.344.t:0 "The Verona Conference Collapses to Itself"
 WORLD.344.d:0 "Today, the Verona Conference, the assembly gathered together to determine the future direction of Italian Empire, was supposed to come to an end. Congress, as expected, argued and debated in heat, yet nobody thought it would caught in an eternally bickering state like this. Neither Duce Ciano nor Carlo Scorza managed to get the upper hand, and after realizing the debates are going to no where, both Ciano and Scorza left the congress in frustration. The moment they left, all the congressmen first started to exchange insults, then punches; congress fell to chaos that is more resembling of a bar fight than an assembly to decide the future of one of the greatest nations on Europe.\n\nSupporters of both sides flocked to the streets, to claim superiority over the other which already turned into street brawls. A time of instability awaits Italy and her people, unfolding into unexpected developments."
 WORLD.344.a:0 "Another nation of Europe falls to chaos."

 WORLD.345.t:0 "Italy Wins the Italo-Turkish War" #cianos deal
 WORLD.345.d:0 "For years, the border disputes between Turkey and Italy have been a major cause of disagreements between two allies. The high tensions between two Mediterranean countries peaked after the collapse of Triumvirate, leaving no obstacle before a war. Turkish troops had finally invaded the Italian Middle East. Italy did not stand idle for against the Turkish aggression and a small-scale war between two former allies broke out.\n\nAfter the Turkish war machine ran out of steam, the front stalled and Turkey got bogged down in a stalemate they could not break. Gaining the clear upper hand in the war, Italy proposed a peace treaty with the terms of reparations from the Turkish government and a demilitarization of the Damascus region, terms which have been reluctantly accepted by the Turkish government. Peace once more rules the Middle East now."

However, with his radical policies of expansionism, hatred of foreigners, and belief in 'Akhand Bharat', the world waits in fear and anticipation of Thackeray's next move."

It is a well known secret that they have been extensively aiding right winged terror groups, notably the Iron Guard. This failure hasn't curbed their enthusiasm, however.

The Reichsstaat's ruler, the dreaded Hans Hüttig, is presumed dead. Meanwhile, German settlers, soldiers, and administrative staff are desperately fleeing the continent any way they can.

Bennett utilized his acceptance speech to call on a bitterly divided America to join together as one nation to face down the struggles of the day.\n\nMild-mannered and averse to political extremes, Bennett believes that a middle ground between both sides of the civil rights debate is possible.

Johnson achieved victory in the presidential election. In his victory speech, Johnson praised the continuing endurance of his party, and vowed to carry on the good work of his predecessors.\n\nBullish but progressively-minded, Johnson shares the conviction of former President Kennedy towards the cause of civil rights. Insider voices claim he has some sort of grand project in the works, aimed at improving numerous areas of American society, but Johnson remains tight-lipped.

As a triumphant Wallace gave his acceptance speech, he proudly declared that "the American people have called out in one united voice, and they make one simple demand - stop this nonsense at once!"\n\nNobody can fail to interpret the target of these words, as the segregationist candidate has run on a platform of staunch opposition to the previously ascendant civil rights movement. Renewed clashes between segregationists and civil rights activists have broken out across the South, and Martin Luther King and other prominent voices have condemned the sudden reactionary turn of events."

However, he also believes in diverting funding to America's growing military-industrial complex, so as to better protect against the other powers.

He has vowed to push America forward in the Space Race, promising massive funding increases to NASA and elaborated on extravagant mission plans to once and for all put America ahead of the fascists in the realm above. Critics call him an idealist who intends to throw away money on unnecessary passion projects, but many others cheer on his bold vision, and hope that he might usher America, and the world, into a new age of science."

Having written extensively on the subject in his time as an activist, Harrington finally has the chance to let the voice of the "Other America" be heard.

Disillusioned with American politics, he garnered support under the guise of cutting down on wasteful government spending and reallocating those funds to the military.

Germany and Japan, in particular, seem pleased that such a peaceable man has come into office.\n\nExperts believed that the flames of American revanchism burned too brightly for a McGovern victory, but it appears that they were wrong.

It was also poorly received by the more extreme elements of the NPP, notably the L-NPP and the Yockeys. Regardless, it appears America will not embrace extremism for the sake of survival, as a new, progressive president steps up. Few expect Jackson to truly act upon his threats towards the Germans and Japanese. Most seem to believe that his administration will just prove to be another four years of American posturing.

In the OFN and Japan the news was met somewhat less well, with many now wary of a new, militant America.

At the end of a long process of gradual concessions to native organizations, the Jerusalem Conference has ended with the partition of the Italian Levant into several independent nations, including a Jewish state, joined in an economic union with each other and with Italy.\n\nWhile this decision was surrounded by controversy, especially regarding topics such as the status of Jerusalem, the public opinion seems to be generally in favor of it, at least for now, as the territories previously under Italian administration are now independent. The more optimistic commentators have called the partition the first step towards true peace in the Levant, but many remain skeptical, predicting that the partition will only end up causing further conflict among the numerous ethnic and religious groups of the region.\n"

At the end of a long process of gradual concessions to native organizations, the Jerusalem Conference has ended with the creation of a new country - the Levantine Confederation. Made up of the former Governorate of the Levant, the confederation is a multicultural, pluralistic country with a confessionalist government, designed to ensure representation for the many ethnic groups living in its borders.\n\nWhile the decision was surrounded by controversy, as there are still several pressure groups in the country advocating for independence, the public opinion seems to be generally favorable. The more optimistic commentators believe that the confederation will be able to ensure peace in the region, but many are more skeptical and see it as a shaky union inevitably destined to break up among religious and ethnic strife.\n"

 WORLD.922.d:0 "Following a long and complex process of negotiations, which failed to find a compromise solution for the convoluted situation in the Italian Levant, the Jerusalem Conference has ended with the formal declaration of the United Arab Kingdom, a newly formed country which will encompass the entirety of the former Italian possessions in the region. Abdullah I bin Al-Hussein,  Hashemite emir of Transjordan, has been chosen as the king.\n\nThe decision to hand over control to Abdullah was not sudden - the emir collaborated with Italy in exchange for autonomy for his emirate, and quickly rose to prominence as one of the main leaders of the Arabs in the country. Promising to rule according to secular and constitutional principles, allowing autonomy and freedom to all the ethnicities of the Levant, Abdullah is still enormously unpopular among the Jews of Palestine, and many of them are apparently already organizing to set up resistance to his rule.\n"

Upon assuming power, they promised to use the might of their military forces to keep the region stable and peaceful as Italian allies - but the fierce Zionist bend of its leaders and the immediate reaction of Arab elements might spell an early doom for the newly-created State of Israel.\n"

However, the new democratic republic appears unstable at best, as there is little unity between the numerous guerrillas, militant groups and organizations that make it up, and Zionist opposition to the communist government is already starting to flare up in Jewish majority areas.\n"

In the ensuing power vacuum, the Zionist nationalist militia known as Irgun, led by Menachem Begin, has taken control of the region, proclaiming the State of Israel.\n\nOne of the most prominent Zionist organizations in the region, Irgun has been violently agitating for a Jewish state for years - but it was only recently that they could gather enough support among the Jews of the region to seize power. Owing their triumph to the division and infighting in the Arab camp, Irgun however is now in control of a vast region populated by an Arab majority bitterly opposed to Jewish rule. The newly founded Israeli state is a minority government, and there are already many reports of systemic discriminations against Arabs and other ethnic groups.\n"

The numerous acts of violence committed by the Italian forces have driven many Arabs to embrace the PLF-GC and its virulently nationalistic and violent rhetoric, calling for the establishment of an Arab state purely for Arabs in the Levant.

Exploiting divisions among the Arabs, Lehi managed to assert its control over the whole Levant, and is preparing to realize its vision of a Jewish state inhabited by Jews alone - reports of violence and deportations are multiplying, as Arab refugees flee the Levant for the neighbouring states.\n"

Nowhere is this strange contradiction more visible than in the Persian Gulf, where the Italian Governorate of the Gulf was granted independence as the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAs the Middle East finds itself gripped by a new wave of instability, Italy has opted to grant independence to their vital territories in the Persian Gulf, granting autonomy to the local emirates reunited into a federation led by the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.

For the most part, Italy remained alone, and it seemed it would stay that way for a long time. However, both the OFN and the Co-Prosperity Sphere have recently been making overtures to the Italians in an attempt to align them with their spheres of influence. The realization that a rival is attempting to win over the Italians has only made the two powers more keen to win over them over.\n\nInternational relations experts agree that the prize of Italy is quite bountiful, with their control over a large amount of the world's oil supply, combined with their control over the Suez Canal, which would give either alliance an incredibly powerful foothold in the Mediterranean. Of course, the Germans watch these negotiations with bitterness, as this will give one of the great power blocs of the world a direct border with the Reich itself.\n"

While Egypt became de facto an Italian governorate during the reign of Farouk, the increased efficiency and popularity of the post-Farouk government has convinced Rome to start a process to restore full independence to the North African country.\n\nThe Italian plenipotentiary in Egypt, Marshal Italo Balbo, has been tasked with overseeing this process, which is likely to end with an independent Egypt that is, however, still closely tied to Italy's sphere.

At the same time attempting to present himself as a reformist and keeping an alliance with the Saudi monarchy, al-Badr has played his cards well.\n\nAbdullah al-Sallal, on the other hand, has support from a large portion of the military, himself a prior general of al-Badr's royal guard.

Openly advocating for white rule in the Dark Continent, Correntia has set itself up as a fascist, white nationalist state, promising to ensure the protection of white settlers and the continuation of the European mission to civilize Africa, whatever the costs.\n\nNominally led by former mercenary Tullio Moneta, Correntia is controlled by a clique of industrialists, financers, and former fascist administrators who opposed Amedeo, and other remnants of the old fascist order of East Africa, who wish to continue the Italian exploitation of the Horn of Africa. With strong African resistance to Correntia still present, it's hard to say how long this brutal regime will last, but Correntia's victory, even if ephemeral, means a complete defeat of any of Italy's projects to restore peace to the region.\n"

Oil has played a crucial part in the global conflict between Germany, Japan and America, being the most valuable resource in transportation and warfare.\n\nWith the outbreak of conflict, and the need for oil becoming immense, the powers of the world once more eye the region of festering conflict with great interest, looking to support whichever factions, nations, or leaders that will allow for economic footholds.

Italy, whose influence is exerted greatly upon the Balkan Peninsula, not only faces a state whose territorial ambitions are directly in conflict with Italy's holdings, but a state who is fervently opposed to fascism, desiring to destroy it wherever it may be found.\n\nIt is unknown if the Italians will attempt to destroy the Yugoslavs for a second time, or if Tito will pursue these ambitions at all.

Being a point of crisis, as communists, nationalists, and other disgruntled groups fight one another, some have seen it as more of a burden to the empire than a benefit. With a desire to not lose control of their empire, whilst simultaneously expanding their sphere and relieving these issues, Italy has transferred the territory to Serbia, expanding its sphere into the nation. Serving as a further road into the Balkans, and a balance against the agitating communists to the north in Croatia, this may be just the deal that Rome needed.\n"

The colony may have dark days ahead of it, as the never-quite-eradicated Ethiopian nationalist rebels continue their guerilla actions from deep within the mountains, and there are some rumours that several Italian colonists and settlers are growing more and more intolerant of Addis Abeba's lenient policy towards natives.\n"

As laudable as his views might be, they were not while received by many Italians who viewed them as nothing short of treachery, or by most Africans, who desired national liberation after decades of oppression. But against all odds, Guillet triumphed, and so far has been surprisingly lenient to the many parties who opposed him.\n\nWhile Guillet continues to push for gradual decolonization and the establishment of Italian-friendly independent nations, his superiors in Rome are deeply ambivalent about such an idea.

Some, particularly those oppressed by Qasim's administration have taken up arms in a bid for an Iraq of their own.

Meanwhile, religious traditionalists and tribal elements have rallied around Ghalib Alhinai, the Omani imam, in the inhospitable region of the Jebel Akhdar - with the strength of faith and Saudi support, they hope to restore theocratic rule to the country.\n\nAnother insurrection took place in the western deserts of Dhofar, where a large coalition of pan-Arabists, communists, and Ba'athists rose up under partisan leader Layla Fakhro, hoping to turn Oman into a stronghold of pan-Arabism in Southern Arabia.

While the German offensive was not unforeseen, meaning that Italian defenses were already on high alert, it's yet unclear if Italy will be able to resist the onslaught of the German war machine.\n\nAs the two major European members of the Axis turn on each other, the fate of Europe hangs in the balance. Germany intends to knock down its major rival for control of the continent now that it's at its weakest, while at the same time seizing the vast oil reserves of the Italian Empire.

Allowing and supporting German occupation of the country, Farinacci's government clearly only exists thanks to German boots stomping on Italian soil, and the newly installed duce has already declared the restoration of "eternal friendship and brotherhood" between Italy and Germany.

This event has only contributed to the ferocious political clashes happening every day on the Italian streets between striking workers, policemen, student groups and even neo-fascist organizations - many are losing hope in Italy's nascent democracy, and some speculate that this is only the start of a long period of violence and terror in the country.\n"

While only containing few probes to conduct experiments on long range radio communication in the upper atmosphere, San Marco 1 was designed largely as a test for Italy's capabilities to launch spacecraft into orbit.\n\nDespite the relatively small scientific importance of San Marco 1, especially when compared to the much more developed German, American and Japanese space programs, the success of the endeavour was viewed as a major symbolic victory by Italy, which became the first non-superpower to successfully perform a space launch.\n"

Faced with brutal repression, many have taken to the mountains, from where partisan units have begun to wage an insurgency.\n\nPartisans have not only taken up residence in the far fringes of the empire, like Albania and Tunisia, but also mountainous regions in the Alps and the Apennines where partisans have begun to use the difficult terrain to their advantage. Several regions are already hotbeds of insurgency, with some areas even organizing themselves as 'partisan republics'.

While many of Scorza's reforms have had outright catastrophic effects in many regards and a strong insurgency still exists in the republic, the PFR is still the only political force capable of controlling the country - at least for now.\n"

Already, emergency talks are feverishly held between political parties, law enforcement, and even the royal court, about how to respond to this attack.

Pro-Unionist and leftist politicians fled the building immediately, leaving the governance of the state to a wholly nationalist faction.\n\nCayo's militant supporters, known as the Free Welsh Army, were considered an impossibly disparate fringe group for most of its history. When the coal industry slumped, the FWA rapidly consolidated support among the discontents of this crash and blazed ahead towards a coup d'état.

As a gesture of "goodwill," the Norfolk Accords were signed on the USS Wisconsin, one of the few surviving U.S. capital ships from the 40s. Under a pole waving the stars and stripes, the U.S. embargo of Germany formally ended. Saying Germany was humiliated would be an understatement. Under the accords, Germany is forced to improve slave conditions, give American investors priority in their market, and severely reduce their nuclear stockpiles. While America proclaims a new era of peace, her counterpart has been mute. German citizens are disgusted at the diplomatic humiliation; even the most loyal of Speer's supporters have nothing to say.

After weeks of brewing tensions escalating between the Empire of Japan and the United States of America, who was thought to be responsible for the sinking of the Tosa following several sightings of American submarines in the area, the American people have calmed down from the jump of accusations and the president has pulled the nation away from the crisis.\n\nHaving been defeated in the wake of the Second World War, the people of the United States have held a direct scorn against the Empire of Japan for nearly the past twenty years.

In the sinking, two hundred and fifty-three Japanese seamen were killed as radio communications aboard the vessel died during the ssinking. However, after weeks of posturing the notion of the American's involvement in the crisis, the prime minister of Japan declared an official stepping back from rising escalations in wake of accusations and insults between the two nations.\n\nVictorious over the Americans in the wake of the Second World War, the Japanese dominion over the Pacific sea has left their empire in direct contempt with the American people, and have escalated into tensions for years.

Weeks of buildup included the prime minister's accusation of the United States' involvement in the destruction of the ship to the secretary of the navy sending an aircraft carrier down to launch a reconnaissance mission around the area the Tosa sunk, and, finally, it appears as though a surface-to-air missile was responsible for the destruction of the aircraft and the death of her pilot. With this, the United States has entered its first major war in nearly twenty years.\n\nFrom this point on, it is estimated that the full land, air, and sea forces of both the Empire of Japan and the United States of America will be dedicated to waging war within Pacific territories, as the world watches on in fear and terror.

Now there is no turning back. Both nations have moved to formally declare war and are mobilizing their reserves and missile defence systems for a full-scale conflict. It should only be assumed that when the nukes fly neither the uninvolved Empire of Japan or the myriad of smaller powers will be spared, or that they will not retaliate with their own weapons of mass destruction.\n\nTo some, this was inevitable.

WORLD.18007.d:0 "The collapse of Italian authority in Egypt was finally completed today as Gamal Abdel Nasser and the forces of the Egyptian Revolutionary Council have triumphed in the land of the pharaohs. Rising anti-Italian and anti-colonial sentiment in Egypt had culminated in a failed coup d'état by the Free Officers Movement, sparking a multi-sided civil war. Despite the failure of their initial coup, Nasser's forces have successfully defeated their opponents and proclaimed the new Arab Republic of Egypt.\n\nNasser and his movement are staunch anti-colonialists and firm believers in the idea of a pan-Arab state, views that have proven to quite popular amidst the Egyptian public. International observers regard their victory in Egypt as a major blow to the Italian Empire amidst the ongoing Oil Crisis and the possible beginnings of a new power bloc in the Middle East and North Africa."

WORLD.18008.d:0 "Fears that the recent Egyptian Civil War would lead to the collapse of Italian authority in the country have proven to be misplaced. Italy's influence in Egypt had long been resented by the local populace, culminating in an attempted coup by Abdel Nasser, which soon spiraled in a multi-sided civil war. The victory of the Cairo government over the Free Officers Movement and the Muslim Brotherhood has brought peace back to the land of the pharaohs, to the relief of both Egyptians and Italians alike.\n\nWhile Italy's authority in Egypt appears to have remained intact, much of the population continues to resent the pervasive influence of their ostensible partners. Despite these whispers of dissent, international observers hailed the victory as a sorely needed triumph for Italy, especially given the instability gripping the region."

The Kurdish Democratic Party entered into a strategic alliance with the Iraqi government, and managed to secure victory for loyalist forces via a string of successful operations across the north of the country. In what can be seen as the crowning achievement to a lifetime of revolutionary struggle that spanned three countries and numerous decades by Barzani, agreements were concluded with the Iraqi government just last week, codifying Kurdish autonomy as part of a new, democratic Iraqi constitution.\n\nWith its considerable oil reserves and rising instability in the region, Barzani's Kurdistan is likely to assume a more dominant role in Middle Eastern politics and on the international stage. Barzani personally declared a willingness to work with democratic forces in Italy and around the world to secure prosperity for his new state, as well as a continued struggle for Kurdish rights and democracy abroad."

Now, it appears certain that this attempt failed: Vito Miceli, previously 'advisor' to the government in Baghdad, has managed to successfully navigate the maze that is the Iraqi political scene to deliver an agreement that satisfies everyone - especially the Italian Empire.\n\nAddressing a small group of Iraqi and ENI representatives in Baghdad, Miceli announced his candidates for a new cabinet meant to stabilize the country for the foreseeable future. This piece of news has been well-received in both Italy and in Iraq as a way to end the bloodshed, and Miceli's victory comes as an unexpected, but widely celebrated, triumph for Italy and her ambitions in the Middle East."

A lawyer, writer, and intellectual, al-Bazzaz's success represents a shocking outcome in a country long-defined by a revolving door of autocrats and military leaders.\n\nStanding in front of the damaged remains of the Republican Palace, al-Bazzaz vowed to restart Iraq's long-stalled progress toward a democratic government. He also sought to allay the concerns of Iraq's various minorities who remain fearful of al-Bazzaz's vocal pan-Arab ideals by promising various protections.\n\nWhether al-Bazzaz can see these promises through remains to be seen.

WORLD.18018.d:0 "In an announcement earlier today, the new Iraqi president Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr has declared Ba'athist victory in the country's gruelling civil war. Iraq has harboured one of the largest and most influential branches of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, remaining a persistent holdout of Arab nationalist thought for the past two decades. After brazenly declaring its utmost dedication to the anti-colonial struggle, al-Bakr's regime is likely to pursue a hard line against Italian influence in the region, hoping to act as a \"bastion of Arab nationalism against the tide of colonial oppression.\"\nSpectators in Iraq and abroad have noted numerous violations and authoritarian stances that the Ba'athist party assumed in its struggle towards power under al-Bakr and his nephew, Saddam Hussein; few minority leaders have high hopes for national autonomy within the now decidedly Arab state. Nonetheless, the Ba'athists continue to preach ideals of Liberty and Socialism: only time will tell if they will ever be truly realized.\n"

WORLD.18019.d:0 "Today, it has become apparent that the victor of the Iraqi Civil War was the Ad-Dawa Shia movement, who have managed to mobilize the Shia-majority population upon a platform of ethnic and religious tolerance. Spiritual leader Ayatollah Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei gave a concise speech in Baghdad where he reaffirmed the party's intentions to rule in harmony with all of Iraq's population.\n\nBased on a semi-democratic political system promoting Islamic values and ethics, Ad-Dawa was incredibly popular amongst Iraq's Shiite population, a popularity which only grew as al-Khoei assumed leadership and called for a democratic and tolerant Islamic government. While more hardline voices wonder just how tolerance might contain the very real threat of nationalism and Iraq's Sunni population braces for waves of discrimination, al-Khoei has not balked away from the challenges but assured a rightful and just government benefiting all Iraqis.\n"

It appears that the specter of pan-Arabism has been firmly quashed in Yemen.\n\nKing Muhammad al-Badr has made overtures to both Riyadh and Rome to gain support in the Yemeni Civil War, presenting himself as a staunch defender of Italian interests, while at the same time forging contacts with the Saudi king.

Yet, the general-turned-president has announced his intent to turn Yemen into a bastion of pan-Arabism in the Arabian Peninsula, with ambitions that serve as a direct challenge to both the Saudi monarchy and the Italian Empire.

WORLD.18100.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of the American-led OFN Mandate in Angola, the region has once again been engulfed in the fires of chaos in the wake of the South African War. After the collapse of the Südwestafrika and the OFN occupation, efforts were made to build a foundation for a long lasting post-colonial peace. General Lavelle had been engaged for some time now in talks between the MPLA and UNITA, both of which were founded in response to German rule and were hostile to any Western presence, but differing substantially in their long-term goals once the interlopers had been pushed out. While the American government was clear in their commitment to stay no longer than was needed, talks collapsed in a massive swamp of paranoia and suspicion.

This news from Luanda comes on the heels of an announcement that an agreement for decolonization was reached between General John Lavelle and UNITA and MPLA. International observers have noted that forming a peaceful settlement with these two movements reflected positively for the future of the region. Still, many were quick to note that this agreement would likely not end many of the groups' disagreements, and only time will tell if they can truly coexist.

This is a severe blow to the U.S. strategic interests in the region, only recently freed from the German colonial regime and has sent Washington into an uproar. Even greater than the frustration of the United States' government is that of the investors who had lucrative deals with Reichskommissar Siegfried Müller, a majority of which carried over to the OFN administration. The investors now stand to lose millions and still more now that the Congo Dam is out of friendly hands, German or American.

He particularly emphasized the OFN's willingness to help in cleaning up remnants of the mercenary armies that had dominated the region under German rule. Still, experts have expressed skepticism that the nations of the Congo region will be able to coexist peacefully as long as ethnic and territorial tensions continue to exist.

It was the hope of General Westmoreland that he could bring peace to such a troubled land, but it seems that it was too great a hope. The regional leaders have seized on mounting instability and faltering OFN control to proclaim independence and establish several new states.

For the first time in modern history, a vibrant patchwork of peoples will hopefully be able to coexist in sovereign and recognized states.

Having re-established ties with the outside world, the state was recognized by most as the legal successor to the Dominion of South Africa.\n\nIn exchange for said recognition, and facing mounting internal and international pressure for his collaboration with Hüttig, President Hertzog agreed to resign, with Jaap Marais being appointed as the new president. The collapse of German influence in the republic, drawing back to the Reich's half hearted participation in the South African War, is being cited as the main reason for Maria's triumph over the HNP's Germanophile faction."

 ### Thailand Events

WORLD.19000.t:0 "Death of Plaek Phibunsongkhram"
WORLD.19000.d:0 "With recent government purges gripping the attention of the nation, a more unexpected development has brought the Republic of Thailand to a standstill: the death of the Grand Marshal, Father of the Nation, Plaek Phibunsongkhram. From his involvement in the 1932 Revolution against royal absolutism, to leading Thailand to victory in war against the European imperialists, to the declaration of a Thai republic - Phibunsongkhram's legacy is perhaps the greatest in Thai history.\n\nHis passing was announced to the nation by an interim governing council, consisting of various prominent bureaucrats and generals, now entrusted to manage the immediate fallout of the passing of Thailand's pater patriae. However, with power now resting in Bangkok's most cunning schemers, many now wonder how long until the balance of power tips, and violence swallows the young republic."
WORLD.19000.a:0 "The storm before the storm."

WORLD.19001.t:0 "Military Coup in Thailand"
WORLD.19001.d:0 "With the balance of power crumbling in the aftermath of Grand Marshal Phibunsongkhram's death, Admiral and Commander-in-Chief of the Thai Navy Thawan Thamrongnawasawat has gathered his forces to oust what is left of the interim governing council from their executive seats of power. His principled character, reputation, and charismatic leadership had won over the people and, despite rivalries within the service, support of many in the army.\n\nHowever, the situation remains delicate; Admiral Thawan's coalition of support is but a house of cards, only tacitly supported by military leadership. It is currently unknown how the new military administration will handle the current chaos in the young republic, and only time will tell if continued support for Admiral Thawan's government will last."
WORLD.19001.a:0 "Better him than the jaws of death."

WORLD.19002.t:0 "Thailand Holds Elections"
WORLD.19002.d:0 "After three years of President Thawan Thamrongnawasawat's government presiding over the young republic, it has been announced that democratic elections are to be held, before Thawan steps down as president of the Republic of Thailand. His reformation of the Thai government's various ministries and pre-war institutions, now cut free from the abuse of opportunistic generals, is expected to finally be christened with the timely election of a new set of public officials.\n\nAlthough a shock to some, many comment that this is rather a natural conclusion to the years President Thawan's government has spent reshaping antiquated government institutions. Foreign observers anticipate the future of Thailand's recently-lit spark of democracy, now flickering and burning brighter in a land once tortured by autocracy."
WORLD.19002.a:0 "The democratic experiment is born."

WORLD.19003.t:0 "Election of Pridi Banomyong"
WORLD.19003.d:0 "In the first democratic election since the end of the Khana Ratsudon's grip over Thailand, it has been announced by the electoral commission that Pridi Banomyong's campaign for the presidency takes the victor's share, securing a majority in the National Assembly and on the ballot. Speaking publicly to the press and observers, Pridi states his intentions are to respect the newfound democratic constitution of the Republic of Thailand, and the wishes of its people.\n\nMany applaud Pridi's victorious campaign for his desire to defend the security and welfare of the Thai people, despite facing various challenges from both foreign and domestic enemies. Needless to say, international observers note that Pridi's successful election is but another crack in the Japanese sphere, as Thailand begins to turn its ear away from the empire dominating Asia."

WORLD.19004.t:0 "Election of Seni Pramoj"
WORLD.19004.d:0 "With the result duly called by the electoral commission in Bangkok, Seni Pramoj claims a victory in the National Assembly and thus has won the seat of the presidency. A descendant of the Chakri Dynasty, and member of the once-disgraced Seri Thai movement in exile, Seni's ascendancy was unexpected even by those paying close attention to Thailand's first free election.\n\nSuch a radical departure from establishment politics in Bangkok prompts the world to sit and await not only the presidency of Seni Pramoj, but the very health and fate of the newfound Thai democracy under his leadership. What is certain, however, is that this rising democrat's administration is to forever shape the future of the young republic, and the future of those living within it."

Having established his presence within the military bureaucracy decades prior, a rush of armed detachments sprung to storm Bangkok's halls of power, and the General was sworn in as the new president of the republic.\n\nAmong his first actions are calls for loyalty and patriotic fervor; thousands of troops march in the cities of the young republic, saluting the President Thanom as he watches over the nation with scheming eyes. However, as Thailand still licks her wounds, the world watches on as a new tyrant is born west of the Mekong."
WORLD.19005.a:0 "More of the same, it would seem."

WORLD.19006.t:0 "Officers Coup in Thailand"
WORLD.19006.d:0 "The fires of outrage burn in Thailand as citizen demonstrations pack the streets of major cities of the young republic; they protest the cost of General Thanom's saber-rattling on living conditions and domestic security. That was until the challenged military presence had opened fire upon the crowds, cutting down hundreds in brutal mayhem - an action likely authorized by the president himself.\n\nThe resulting bloodshed in the streets of Bangkok had compelled a group of mutinying officers to refuse commands, instead turning their guns to challenge higher command and the presidency. Observers report this disorganized chaos as a second coup in Thailand, yet no one can be sure of what may come of this armed struggle for power."

WORLD.19007.t:0 "Attempted Officers Coup in Thailand"
WORLD.19007.d:0 "The crowded streets of Bangkok were plunged into chaos today, as agitated military presence challenging the civilian protests had opened fire upon the masses of demonstrators; foreign observers comment that the action may have been authorized by the president himself.\n\nA band of mutinying officers, compelled by scenes of civilian massacre and government tyranny, had struggled to depose of the governing authorities and were instead gunned-down as traitors by officers loyal to the regime, their dreams of peace and freedom dying with them. With defiance now made a bloody example of, General Thanom is likely to rule unabated as his reign of terror continues to scourge the young republic."

WORLD.19008.d:0 "In the chaos following Grand Marshal Phibunsongkhram's death, Chatichai Choonhavan has mobilized his forces in a quick seizure of power to claim the presidency for himself. With loyalties established across the civilian administration and military bureaucracies, the new president's men have a firm grip over the rapidly stabilizing situation.\n\nPresident Chatichai's public appearances offer assurances of affluence and prosperity to the public, insisting that security and wealth will return under his leadership. However, his sweet promises are underscored by a shadowy rise in secret-police presence across the country, and observers are yet to be sure of the future of Thailand's domestic security."

 # Japan New News Events
 WORLD.20000.t:0 "Palace Coup in Japan!"
 WORLD.20000.d:0 "Shocking news from the Tokyo Imperial Palace today: Amid governmental chaos and dysfunction, it appears that the Prince Higashikuni, a prominent senior statesman or Jushin, and Lord Privy Seal Kido have ordered the Yokusankai-dominated cabinet to step down and let members of the Royal Family and Imperial loyalists take their place. While official news from Japan has been scant as of late, what few sources are available state that officials are 'greatly concerned about potential conspiracies within the Government'.\n\nNow, the government seems certain to collapse and be replaced with one of Kido and Higashikuni's choosing. The plans of the new rulers of Japan are not yet known. But the fear is that the Japanese Diet will be sidelined completely, and a period of rule by decree will begin. If this is true, then it seems that Japan is backsliding into dictatorship once more."

This was soon followed by General Muto Akira of the IJA being appointed Prime Minister. Almost immediately after his appointment, he ordered the Army to restore order throughout Japan and its capital.\n\nThis all apparently stemmed from the previous government's investigation into the armed forces, which according to Muto turned into a "treasonous and insane witch hunt" that had to be ended. Martial law has now gone into effect. Thousands have been reported arrested and hundreds reportedly shot by military police while foreign correspondents have been forced under house arrest. Muto seems to care little about global condemnation, and is already moving to crush all "harbingers of chaos". As such, all that could be heard from Tokyo for the last 24 hours were:"

 WORLD.50014.t:0 "Margaret Thatcher Elected English Prime Minister"
 WORLD.50014.desc:0 "Margaret Thatcher first grabbed headlines in 1951, when she became the youngest female MP in the Kingdom of England upon her election. Now, she has a new record: first female prime minister. Following the recent victory in the general election, Royal Party members of the House of Commons voted to make Thatcher their party leader, thus making her prime minister.\n\nThe leadership election's result was a shock by many familiar with parliamentary politics, who long thought Thatcher to be an outsider the Royal Party's inner circle always kept at arm's length. Naysayers within the party have largely been quelled by her choice to staff the cabinet with 'old guard' MPs, the most prominent of which is R.A. 'Rab' Butler. The question of whether she leads her cabinet or her cabinet leads her, however, will remain to be seen."

 WORLD.50015.desc:0 "After their victory in the English Civil War, the Royal Party's hold on the country seemed absolute. But their grip is not as tight as one would think, for the recent parliamentary elections saw Reginald Maudling's United England party take control of the House of Commons.\n\nMaudling, along with the more pragmatic MP Harold Macmillan, championed the Royal Party's reformist wing, though the two frequently butted heads over just how quickly England should transition to democracy. They led a defection to a new party, with Maudling as party leader and Macmillan as chairman, and the recent election has proven their popularity with the English people.\n\nMaudling promises to free England and lead her back to democracy, but with the still-influential Macmillan looking over his shoulder, he may not go as far as others hope.\n"

But Thatcher, as many Royal Party MPs could attest, has proven herself to be as resilient and inflexible as iron.\n\nFor the past several years, she has managed to outmaneuver Rab Butler and the other titans of the Royal Party, turning their attempts to undermine her into opportunities to consolidate her own power. This most recent general election saw Royal Party maintain its majority in the House of Commons, proving that Thatcher could not only manage her grip on her own party, but also cement her influence across the country.\n\nAnd now, continuing her reign as prime minister of England, Margaret Thatcher is free to advance her political agenda - and for once, it actually will be her own.\n"
 WORLD.50016.a:0 "The puppet's snapped her strings."

 WORLD.50017.t:0 "Reginald Maudling Re-elected Prime Minister"
 WORLD.50017.desc:0 "In an unsurprising turn of events, the United England Party, led by Prime Minister Reginald Maudling, has secured another majority in parliament. Rising to prominence after splitting from the Royal Party after their victory in the English Civil War, Maudling's government has taken a slow, yet steady approach to democratizing England.\n\nHowever, this course of action has confused many political commentators, because England's slow return to democracy is a stark contrast to Maudling's fiery promise of a free and independent England. It is speculated that Harold Macmillan, chairman of the United England party, is the one calling the shots, and Maudling is his mere puppet. Perhaps Maudling tried to break free of Macmillan, but as shown by his somewhat subdued victory speech, he must have failed.\n\nWhat Maudling, or perhaps more accurately Macmillan intends to do with their second term remains a mystery.\n"

But Thatcher proved herself to be as resilient and inflexible as iron, much to the chagrin of her handlers.\n\nAnd now, it seems that they have had enough. After years of trying to steer her and being rebuffed at every turn, the Royal Party's old guard have decided that she was no longer worth the trouble and began a motion of no confidence against the prime minister. The motion passed, leading to Thatcher's dismissal as Royal Party leader and prime minister.\n\nIn her stead now sits R.A. 'Rab' Butler, one of her would-be puppetmasters. And now, without Thatcher anymore, Butler may start implementing their agenda unimpeded.\n"

Citing numerous justifications, the generals proclaimed that parliament would be dissolved indefinitely until further notice, and executive power would fall to a panel of military officers in the meantime.\n\nDespite their repeated insistence that this government was meant to be "transitional" and would be dissolved "with all due haste," many people both within and without the British Isles have a hard time believing the claim. Those who seize power often are loathe to relinquish it.\n"

Wilson has come to embody the compromise between moderate social democrats and militant socialists after a leading member of the Labour Underground. He proved crucial in bringing leftist support to HMMLR, and is still aided by the Left Resistance commander, Bill Alexander.\n\nThe Wilson cabinet promises sweeping reforms from the dissolution of the English monarchy to a comprehensive welfare state.

He was recruited by Auchinleck, becoming HMMLR's main liaison to America; from there Jellicoe has risen to the leadership of the NDL.\n\nThe NDL is an ideological motley, including just about anyone who wishes to restore the monarch and democracy, and hopes of coalescing these factions into a coherent political party are yet to be founded."

Maintenance of the country's closeness with the OFN was also stressed by the government.\n\nWilson then touted his recent achievements, claiming the English economy was stronger than ever, with workers enjoying well paying jobs that treated them well.\n\nReginald Birch, leader of the hardliner faction of the SLP, was noted to be absent. Reports suggest Birch and his followers were expelled from the party after a rousing speech by Wilson himself. And so the SLP, for now, stand united in delivering their vision to England."

Prime Minister Jellicoe spoke of his victory as a "resounding victory for the forces of liberal democracy in England and across the world." As such, Jellicoe's England looks set to expand her ties to the OFN.\n\nThe NDL ran on a promise to restore the rightful monarch to her throne, and today, the queen stands more popular than ever, in contrast to her much hated uncle.\n\nAccording to internal party reports, the NDL has walked a fine line to maintain moderate control over the party without antagonizing the Conservatives and Liberals. This balancing act has been crucial in passing needed reforms and keeping party unity. Only time will tell if the scales will tip in either direction, and if Jellicoe can keep his party afloat."

History repeats itself today in England as hardline members of the Socialist Labour Party launched a soft coup against Harold Wilson, forcing him out of the party leadership.\n\nThe newly-appointed prime minister, Reginald Birch, has proclaimed a Socialist Republic of England. In a televised speech, he denounced "reactionary plotters" within the SLP, claiming that they "choked the flame of revolution and plunged the workers into darkness."\n\nThe new government's goals include: massive industrialization, military expansion, and economic autarky. But with their ideology making them effectively a pariah to much of Europe, it is hard to imagine this new state standing on its own for long."

Auchinleck announced that he and his forces had the prerogative to defend English democracy against all internal and external aggressors, and that circumstance forced him to take action.\n\nThe YDL government is set to establish a transitional government to better establish a democratic system.

Preceding the trial of TD Neil Blaney, leader of a Hardliner faction within Fianna Fáil, a faction of the Irish Defence Forces lead by Generals James Kelly and Sean McKeown stormed the the former Taoiseach's office, arresting him for high treason against the Republic, and anointed the Hardliner leader the new Taoiseach in Lemass's place.\n\nThe new regime is said to be extremely Germanophillic, and will likely be seeking greater integration into the Einheitspakt in the coming days. Officials in Germania are reportedly ecstatic at the news, and will likely welcome the new government into the Pakt with open arms. International observers have condemned the new government, stating concerns of violent repression and new restrictions on common liberties."

Taking advantage of the death of rebel paramilitary leader Seamus Twomey, Ian Paisley led a popular revolt in the Northern Counties Special Zone, declaring Ulster to be independent and separate from the republic itself.\n\nAfter the capture of the city and the reported death of Ian Paisley, the paramilitary group surrendered, laying down their arms. The Irish government will not be granting the county its special autonomous status back, according to Irish officials, but will integrate it fully into the republic as "just another county, with no special privileges." Unrest brims throughout the county, and will likely continue throughout the near future."

In another shocking blow to Ireland, the military has occupied the Irish dáil and overthrown the government. Chief of Staff Sean McKeown has announced to the world that the current government was "ineffective in maintaining the territorial integrity of Ireland". Whether the Irish military will maintain their control over the state temporarily or cement their power is unknown.\n\nIn Ulster, the fighting appears to still be ongoing.

The Protestant UVF under Ian Paisley has sat down with Seamus Twomey's left-wing Catholic SE and Seán Lemass in Northern Ireland's Stormont Parliament to sign a peace agreement. The main terms of this deal were for Ireland to leave the Pakt and hold regional elections in exchange for a cease-fire.\n\nAny fear of economic fallout caused by an abrupt departure from the Pakt seems to be ignored by the Irish population, who are celebrating the peaceful resolution to the Ulster Arms Crisis.

At times imprisoned and suppressed by the CHP's authoritarian regime, Boran represents a generation robbed of their rights and liberties. As the leader of the DYP, Boran was nominated to the Presidency by consensus of democratic groups - the party is especially popular among the students, though it draws the ire of the establishment, both religious and secular.\n\nThe DYP's rejection of the last forty years of politics would be unimaginable were it not for the unpopularity of the CHP following the defeat of the Italo-Turkish War.

 WORLD.18122.desc:0 "After years of seeming inactivity, an alliance between the Philippines' two largest rebel groups has commenced its largest attack against the Second Philippine Republic to date. Border towns are engulfed by gunfire and artillery shells as the Joint Anti-Laurelist Offensive shatters the conflict's long stalemate. Caught largely by surprise, the Philippine Constabulary and Japanese 14th Army have been forced to conduct fighting retreats, and in some cases were routed off the battlefield completely.\n\nQuestions abound now that the conflict nears the Pearl of the Orient with every inch gained or ceded. Will the so-called "Puppet Republic" survive its ordeal? Will it fall? Who will fell it: the socialists to the north, or the old Commonwealth's remnants to the south? How will the Sun and Eagle respond? Time will tell."

 WORLD.18123.desc:0 "A bastard son proves his worth as a man in a baptism of fire. It is a tale as old as time, and now the Second Philippine Republic, once regarded as false pretenders kept alive by the almighty yen, adds another entry to the hallowed catalogue.\n\nOnce close to national extinction, the men of Manila had held until the dreaded insurgents wore themselves out, after which commenced a brutal counteroffensive all the way to their strongholds. Celebrations dragged on for days and nights after President Jose Yulo announced the surrender of the last major rebel holdout in Mindanao Island. The worst, it seems for many, is over.\n\nAlthough the pains of reconstruction await, the Filipino people can now face them with their heads held high no matter what."

 WORLD.181233.desc:0 "Days of festivities abruptly became days of mourning as the Philippine General Hospital announced that José Yulo Yulo, second President of the Republic of the Philippines, had succumbed to his wounds at 9:28 PM yesterday evening. This comes as a blow to the fledgling republic, who had just emerged from a crisis with the departed at its helm.\n\nWhile the Office of the President ordered half-masts at government buildings and issued details for his funeral, the National Assembly hurriedly convened an extraordinary session to decide Yulo's successor. Insider accounts unveiled political sausage-making at its ugliest as the KALIBAPI's factions, once united by war, vie with and against each other in pursuit of the land's highest office. Hence a new president may not be forthcoming, they said, for several months."

 WORLD.181234.desc:0 "Shocking news has arrived from the heart of the Orient's Pearl as reports of casualties from the city flood in day by day from what is now dubbed the "Manila Incident." The unraveling of an unknown series of events has caused the capital city of the victorious Second Philippine Republic to fall into disarray, with rioters seen wreaking havoc in the streets. Some speculate that this was caused by a botched reconstruction campaign to rebuild the country in the aftermath of the JALO, but no one knows for sure.\n\nWith Manila in anarchy, 14th Army General Masazumi Inada disbanded the National Assembly shortly after its members relocated to the northern city of Baguio. He has since invoked his powers to preside over an interim military government until Manila is pacified. News organizations are finding it difficult to attain more details on the unfolding situation, as the city is deemed to be too dangerous to venture into.\n"

His land's material condition, thus it is said, is ground as fertile for revolution as it is for rice, blossoming a torrent which courses unrelentingly through its mountains and valleys.\n\nManila has now witnessed the red tide firsthand as jubilant workers and peasants hoist their red flag all over the newly-taken city. Meanwhile, Supremo Luis Taruc declared triumphantly that the "fascist and imperialist spectre" that had haunted the country for over four hundred years is nearly vanquished.\n\nAll that is left, he continues, is to prepare for a protracted struggle against Japan's inevitable return.

His "guerrilla army" has defied expectations by ousting the SPR from their national capital in a successful, if protracted and bloody, campaign. Although no less damaged than large swaths of Luzon's largest city, Malacañan Palace now flies Old Glory and the old Commonwealth banner side to side - a first in over twenty years.\n\nInterim President Yulo and his Cabinet had evacuated to Tokyo prior to the siege; no formal surrender seems forthcoming despite their setback. Across the Pacific, Americans and Filipino expatriates alike rejoice at the long occupation's surprising end.\n\nNevertheless, homecoming celebrations are tempered by the likelihood of a reprisal invasion not unlike that which had toppled the Philippines' last civilian government in 1942.\n"

His appointment comes as a relief for those who resent Malacañan's historically despotic streak. On the other hand, his opponents decry his recalcitrance on pursuing Tagalogisasyon, punishing traitors, and in general committing fully to Jose Laurel's vision.\n\nWill Paredes' laws triumph over a nation of strongmen?

The poet and nationalist firebrand who previously served as president of the 1934 Constitutional Convention took his oath in a traditional ceremony at Rizal Park, the historic park by Manila Bay.\n\nHis inauguration comes after a violent struggle for influence between Japan and the United States. Known as the "Balintawak Blitz," the conflict saw the defeat of both communist insurgents and Commonwealth government remnants. In his inaugural speech, Recto vowed to abandon compromise and to protect his home country against the influence of colonialism.

Darkhorse among the late President Yulo's heirs-apparent, the Cebuano businessman was accompanied by his fellow magnates and the Assemblymen he had courted to ensure his ascent.\n\nOsmeña's inauguration marks the formal end of a violent struggle for influence between Japan and the United States. The "Balintawak Blitz," as it is called, saw both communist insurgents and Commonwealth Army remnants defeated by government forces - a tragedy, said their new commander-in-chief, he enjoins Filipinos on all sides to forgive.

Early this morning, advance groups belonging to Shinobu Takayama's 14th Army came ashore in the Ilocos region of Luzon island. With the element of surprise, the Japanese forces were able to quickly capture the cities of San Fernando and Dagupan.\n\nWhile the attack was able to take the Fillipino defenders by surprise, it was known to be only a matter of time until Japan came calling once more.

Taruc was quick to exploit the president's setbacks, tarring him as an incompetent before the Assembly while stoking dissent within a slowly disillusioned populace.

His denouncements proved decisive among the Coalition's alienated Assemblymen, who subsequently abandoned Tañada's vacillations for the decisive action Magsaysay espoused. Paired with the Army's unconditional support of its own, and perhaps today's events were obvious in hindsight.\n\nAlthough the new Soldier-President promised more democratic rule once "the situation has defused", many an op-ed wondered when such a moment will arrive - or if it will ever arrive at all.\n"

While the front initially split from the Einheitspakt following the establishment of the Reichsstaat, it would seem as though bygones are bygones so far as Germany is concerned, as the two have long since mended their worn ties.\n\nOf course, it seems that the other world powers are infuriated at this development. As the Congo reenters the German sphere, Japan and America are left without an ally in the region. With the situation calming down, it's safe to say that Germany has regained a firm foothold in Afrika.\n"

From the horror of the South African War, the betrayal of the traitorous Reichsstaat and it's depressing collapse, it seemed as though Germany's expeditions into Afrika were all doomed ventures- until the movement which incidentally collapsed the Reichsstaat, a coalition of bureaucrats and Generals, beat out all competitors in the Congo war.\n\nThe reaction in Germany has been one of absolute delight, as additional reserves are sent to the region to stabilize the reacquired territory. With the international community largely disappointed, and OFN and Sphere representatives denouncing the reconnection of Zentralafrika to the German economic sphere, it seems safe to say that Germany has come out on top of the Congo.\n"

Working off of his corporate state and nothing else, Katanga has managed to put down the rebellions surrounding it, the remnant Germans holding out in the region, all without foreign support of any kind. Needless to say, their victory has been met with nearly no support whatsoever.\n\nThis loss for the world powers is not totally without merit, however. As Jean has himself confirmed in a speech to all of the Congo that he "will not let Africa be without impact on the world's affairs" as he has announced a determination to strike trade deals with all that the region can manage.

It goes without saying that the world powers have been totally humiliated, as warfare theorists have been left baffled as to the sheer tactical skill of the Kasain military. Many point towards the genius in exploiting the open flanks of these states, though others shift the blame to the other internationally-backed Congolese warlords as not pulling their weight.\n\nAs the state has immediately taken upon the task of recovering from the conflict, it has long been established that the Kasai has no intention of interacting with the superpowers of the world, and has entered a state of economic isolation.

Following his coup of the Azandeland government with his accused co-conspirators, few still refer to it as a conspiracy theory. \n\nHaving received hefty Japanese backing throughout and immediately following the Congo Wars, it is expected that Mobutu's civilian dictatorship will move fast to establish its presence, if nothing else."

The United States released a statement calling for stability for the nation, a tacit admission of support to Savimbi's embattled administration.

However, discrimination towards Jews in particular continues to be the largest criticism of the Habash government. Additionally, satellite, 'sister republics' have been established in Transjordan and Lebanon, creating a small - but powerful - communist bloc in the region.\n\nChairman Habash has shown the world his dream for Palestine - and as the international community looks once more to the east, it remains to be seen if that dream will come true.\n"

Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, hailed by many as the father of the Republic of India and the architect of its political framework, died at 6:25 in the early morning of 27th May, after a sudden illness.\nAccorded a state funeral, the flag-draped body of the deceased statesman was kept under constant vigil by senior Indian Army personnel, and was then cremated on the banks of the Yamuna in a public event. A public notice of sadness at Nehru's departure has been circulated from Kolkata, but it appears that the reaction of the Government of Free India is only stony-faced silence.\nFor the people the only reaction has been a sense of immense loss and of an era past. Of the generation of larger-than-life heroes that dominated the freedom struggle, only Subhas Chandra Bose in a hostile neighboring government survives.\n"

Experts report a growing rift within the Congress Party that the new prime minister will have to control should he not wish to find his own party divided under his nose as he looks eastwards.\nHowever, with the growing economic crisis affecting Kolkata, it appears that the initial attempts at seeking out strategic meetings have borne fruit.

As one of his first actions was setting up a taskforce of economists and public policy planners, it appears this action is also Raghavan's first concern.\nThe accession of Raghavan to the top of Free India - and by extension, the entire movement built by Bose - has not been received uncontroversially.

As Roy was a prominent women's leader, it appears that social reform will be the top priority of the new administration. Roy's chief backer, R.S.

While the junior partners in the coalition, the Gandhians, have insisted on handling the governance of rural areas, the new government's main priority is reviving the economy and building up the nascent conservative movement within the country by allying with middle businessmen, former princes, and any other parties that opposed the Nehruvian Congress before.\nWhether this government will be able to realize its ambitious visions after two decades of socialist-oriented governance remains to be seen.\n"

The United States has stated they are monitoring the situation, emergency meetings have been held, and the Pentagon has put soldiers on alert.

Across the former Ordensstaat, French and German soldiers are welcomed as heroes as nation-wide celebrations take place.\n\nGermany and France have slowly begun releasing information concerning the conditions many were living in, which show widespread poverty, and the abuses of the SS without restrictions.

 WORLD.105.desc: "Many people across the world breathe a sigh of relief as Germany and the United States announced that they have reached an agreement regarding the territory of the former Ordensstaat. Both sides have agreed to demilitarize the borders, withdraw their forces to their respective nations, allow the French to establish control over their former lands.\n\nObservers have confirmed that soldiers and military equipment are rapidly departing Burgundy, and humanitarian aid from the Organization of Free Nations is pouring in, as each member nation has pledged support in helping rebuilding the nation. As the French begin the difficult task to healing from the trauma Himmler inflicted, the rest of the world relaxes, knowing that a crisis in Western Europe has been averted."
 WORLD.105.a: "The clock moves from midnight."

 WORLD.106.t: "The Burgundian Crisis"
 WORLD.106.desc: "Fears of war have been raised across the world as both German and American governments have denounced each other, and each angrily departed the negotiations surrounding the former Ordensstaat. Both nations have stated that they would not be departing Burgundy, and soldiers on both sides have been placed on high alert. Emergency meetings have also been called in Washington and Germania, though neither nation has commented on their nature.\n\nWhile neither side has committed to direct conflict, more men and equipment have been observed moving to supply each side. Leaked messages sent to the Pakt and OFN by their respective leaders warn of a "potential escalation" in coming days. With neither Germany or the United States willing to negotiate further, many fear that the crisis will only deepen in the coming - and risk draggin the world into another world war.\n"

 WORLD.107.t: "France Demands Territorial Restoration"
 WORLD.107.desc: "As tanks roll through the streets of Ost-Paris, Germany has announced that it has secured control over the former Ordensstaat Burgund, and successfully eliminated Heinrich Himmler, the rebellious SS Legions, and the nascent French Resistance. They have declared the day one of liberation, and stated their intent to rebuild and restore the territory.\n\nThe French State, which did not intervene during the conflict, has also officially demanded that Germany "Immediately return rightful French territory", though it was unclear what leverage they have to enforce this. There has so far been no response from Germany, though some sources have indicated that German and French negotiators have made contact. It remains unknown how these discussions will proceed."
 WORLD.107.a: "The German price will be high."

 WORLD.108.t: "Germany Returns French Territories"
 WORLD.108.desc: "Celebrations have broken out across the French State, and the former Ordensstaat as France announced that Germany has agreed to return all rightful French lands to their possession. The French government has planned to hold a nation-wide celebration from Paris, as well as promising to fully restore, rebuild, and heal what was destroyed under Himmler's reign.\n\nIn a less-covered announcement, Germany also released a statement confirming that France would officially rejoin the Einheitspakt, which many are speculating was the price Germany demanded for returning French lands.\n\nWhile the newfound alignment between France and Germany has come as a surprise to some experts, few in France appear to care about the geopolitical implications. Their nation has been restored, and for that, they celebrate.\n"
 WORLD.108.a: "Vive la France!"

 WORLD.109.t: "Germany Refuses French Territorial Restoration"
 WORLD.109.desc: "Tensions between the French State and Germany reached a new high, as Germany unequivocally stated that they would not be returning the former French lands to their previous owners. France has responded by condemning Germany harshly, and revealing that Germany attempted to pressure them into rejoining the Einheitspakt in exchange for their rightful lands.\n\nWhile the OFN has formally condemned the decision, Germany has moved forward in establishing a "temporary restoration government" intended to formalize the stablilization and rebuilding of the region.\n\nFew see a viable path for France to regain their territory without German cooperation, and most experts agree that this decision by Germany has all but ensured that the tensions between the two nations remain permanently high.\n"
 WORLD.109.a: "An injustice perpetuated."

 WORLD.110.t: "The Burgundian Standoff"
 WORLD.110.desc: "While the armies of Heinrich Himmler and those of the SS Legions have been crushed under the combined might of Germany, the United States, and France, the situation remains highly tense in Burgundy. While nominal control has been established over the former Ordensstaat by the armies of both sides, both German and American armies remain on high alert for any sign of aggression from the other.\n\nBoth Germany and the United States have publicly signaled rhetorical deescalation, though observers have noted that both sides remain poised and entrenched along established demarcation lines, in preparation for an escalation. German and American diplomats have been seen moving to Burgundy, and both nations are engaging each other at all diplomatic levels. While all are hoping the situation will stabilize, tensions continue to rise - and fears of a renewed war between the two superpowers with it.\n"
 WORLD.110.a: "It's up to the diplomats now."
 
 WORLD.111.t: "Germany Maintains Influence Over French Lands"
 WORLD.111.desc: "While predicted by many experts following the conquest of Burgundy by Germany, there remained many who were shocked by the German announcement that they were in the process of establishing governments in the former French and Belgium lands - without the input of the French State.\n\nMany believe that this is due to the French State's alliance with Italy, and has caused an expected uproar among the French, who accuse Germany of not even attempting outreach. Italy, along with her allies, has also condemned the German decision, though few expect substantial actions.\n\nNow, many watch closely, and wonder if the new states will be able to sustain themselves, or if a new era of resistance will be born in the war-torn and weary nation."
 WORLD.111.a: "The clock starts over."

 WORLD.112.t: "The Establishment of the French Pakt Commission"
 WORLD.112.desc: "The world responded with a mixture of trepidation and relief when news of the collapse of the SS-Ordensstaat Burgund was confirmed, with Germany mobilizing afterwards to invade the remains of Heinrich Himmler's collapsed state. With order restored, Germany has proclaimed victory over Himmler, and declared that the reign of terror perpetuated by the Reichsführer-SS has ended. \n\nWith the French State in chaos following its collapse after the failed invasion of Brittany, Germany has established the French Pakt Commission, administered by Adolf Heusinger. While the OFN and Italy have expressed concern at the development, with no legitimate French state to protest, the world can only watch - and hope that the new German administration is kinder than the last."

 WORLD_MAN.1.desc: "The dust has cleared in the aftermath of the death of the Emperor Puyi in Manchuria; it is now clear that the late Emperor's brother, one Prince Aisin Gioro Pujie, has taken control of the Manchurian government as its Emperor.\n\nThe new Emperor's path to power was by no means easy: the lack of a clear succession law combined with significant internal opposition has made his success all the more remarkable. Backed mostly by the sovereigntist wing of the governing Concordia Association - and the ancient aristocracy, he has also found some support in the Manchurian Imperial Army.\n\nUnlike his brother Pujie is charismatic and motivated, and has successfully built a strong coalition of supporters behind him. Experts believe it likely that will not be a lame duck emperor; for that reason, many in Tokyo are concerned for what his ascension could mean."

In a speech in the capital of Hsinking, Sejima has solemnly pledged to kick-start Manchukuo's ailing economy, curb the worst inefficiencies of the old system, and propel Manchukuo into the modern age.\n\nDespite talk of modernization, purges of the old guard and dissident factions are already underway, with no indication that they will ease up any time soon."

It is now clear that the Kwantung Army, exploiting partisan activity in the northeast and other internal tensions reaching a breaking point, has seized power and abolished the civil government.\n\nWith Puyi dead the last pretence of Manchurian Soverignty seems to have been dropped with the Monarchy now abolished. To further consolidate their rule, the Kwantung forces have begun a rash of purges in the previous government, and committing the notoriously blunt instrument that is the Kwantung Army to quell civil disturbance in the country once and for all.\n\nWhether or not they succeed, it is clear that the future looks even bleaker for Manchukuo than it did while Puyi still drew breath."

Abolishing the pretence of the monarchy, Gu Ciheng now rules as President of the State of Manchukuo; however, the real power behind the office now lies in Sakomizu Hisatsune, Director of the Sōmuchō.\n\nThe bureaucratic coalition in the new Manchuria is a fervent adherent of technocratic industrial methodsm seeking to reinvigorate Manchukuo's ailing industry through massive state-led industrial plans."

 novel.1.t:0 "Heirs of Babylon"
 novel.1.d:0 ""Heirs of Babylon" is a newly released fiction book detailing an 'alternative' universe in which the Third Reich lost its struggle against the decadent capitalist West and the mongrel states of Russia after our beloved Führer was cut down by a sniper's bullet in 1935. Written by Cornish author Antony Beevor, "Heirs of Babylon" details the lives of people living in divided Berlin, Londium, Alexandria, and Philadelphia - the new capital of the Americas. Much of the world is divided between the Imperial Dominion of Britannia, who have reclaimed their traditional thrones in Germany and France; the United American Federation whose borders stretch from the North Pole to the South Pole; and the insidious pan-Eurasian Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\nFerdinand Featherston is an investigator, a Britannian detective with a licence to kill and beholden only to Her Britannic Majesty. Searching for his wife in red Europe, he is swept up by a world-shaking plot in Berlin. The chase takes him to America, France, Africa and finally to Gibraltar in a series of daring escapes and high-speed gun battles.\n\nThe crux of the novel's events is the Gibraltar Missile Crisis, a tense nuclear standoff between the dominion and the pan-Eurasian union, while the United Federation seeks to undermine both sides and provoke a war for their own purposes.\nThe novel ends in uncertainty, with tanks massing across the Gibraltar border and an American fleet refusing to answer hails circling like vultures. Will Ferdinand use the dominion's most powerful weapons? Will he rescue the woman he loves..."

 novel.2.t:0 "The Greatest Story Never Told"
 novel.2.d:0 "A rather interesting alternate history novel has been gaining some attention around the world, perhaps for all the wrong reasons.\n\n"The Greatest Story Never Told", released two weeks ago, self published by a certain "Bodean Clefton Dixie" (almost certainly a pen name), with a hand drawn cover, which some critics described as "a crude drawing of a tank with a Dixie flag, rolling over a Nazi flag with a hammer and sickle instead of a swastika, within a thought balloon coming out of George Lincoln Rockwell's head".\n\nThe novel is a strange ramble about how if Rockwell hadn't been assassinated "by Judeo-Bolsheviks" he would have created "the greatest story in mankind's history" and goes on to blame his death on "Jews being afraid of what truths he could write".\n\nThe novel has garnered attention, all due to its bizarre tone and claims such as: "Nazi Germany being a Judeo-Bolshevik bastion" due to it being "led by a party who is socialist before it is nationalist" among many other... astonishing claims, which are surprisingly comedic, hence its widespread success in the U.S., and abroad."
 novel.2.a:0 "... I never thought I could laugh like this again. Oh Lord..."

 novel.3.t:0 "The Man in the Iron Fortress"
 novel.3.d:0 "Science fiction author Phillip K. Dick has released his latest novel, named "The Man in the Iron Fortress." A work of speculative alternate history, the novel takes place in a dystopian world where communism reigns supreme. The 'point of divergence' in the story's history is that the socialist politician Eugene Debs remained with the Democrats, becoming president in 1920. As a result, he supported the nascent Soviet Union and the May Fourth movement in China. Debs' beliefs died with him in 1926, and his successor Robert La Follette proved to be far more isolationist, a trend that dominated American politics for the next twenty years. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union became dominated by the authoritarian Felix Dzerzhinsky, while the communists under Mao Tse-tung were able to unite China and counter-invade the Japanese. When the Nazis rose to power, they were able to crush the unsupported Allied nations of Europe, but were unprepared for a surprise Soviet invasion and were swiftly defeated. In 1947, a joint Sino-Soviet army invaded America, leading to them dividing the country north-south.\n\nThe novel is set within occupied America and follows a wide cast of characters, from a Cheka spy to a Chinese official obsessed with American cowboy culture. At the center of its plot is a book called "The Beast Among the Reeds," which tells of a world where both Nazism and communism were defeated. The political backdrop is one of rapidly decaying Sino-Soviet relations; Dzerzhinsky is succeeded after his death by the even more totalitarian Lavrentiy Beria, and the threat of nuclear war looms on the horizon.\n\nDespite the novel's criticism for seemingly unrealistic developments (the Soviets allegedly drained the Baltic Sea for farmland and built a giant bridge stretching across the Bering Strait between Russia and Alaska), Dick has defended the action as being plausible within the best available information he could acquire at the time. That still hasn't stopped the book from becoming a bestseller in the United States and Canada, and it has already been nominated for a Hugo Award."

 novel.4.t:0 "Fear and Loathing in Los Angeles"
 novel.4.d:0 "Earlier this month, noted author and founder of Gonzo journalism Hunter S. Thompson released his newest book, "Fear and Loathing in Los Angeles". Set in a surreal alternate history universe with few rules, the work is a multi-pronged satire on other, more serious alternate history works, as well as a scathing critique of the culture of the United States in the 1970s.\n\nThompson spends dozens of pages going into the minutia of each "divergence point", off-color vignettes within the overarching story that detail how the world of this novel ended up differing from our own. Irreverent and often nonsensical, these stories detail ridiculous episodes, such as a Japanese doctor in Unit 731 accidentally trying a hallucinogenic drug of his own concoction, leading him to paradrop an army of drugged-up "ghouls" into downtown Tokyo. While critics are somewhat split on these stories, casual readers tired of the over-saturation of the fiction market with cheap, overly-serious, "alt-history" novels have found them a welcome, if odd, diversion from the norm.\n\nLinking these various episodes together, Thompson has strung out a vague semblance of a plot in this alternate LA, mainly consisting of cheap allegories to attack contemporary American political culture. In one memorable scene, a street gang closely modeled after the Yockeyites beat up a demonstration of "old yuppie bigots" (Nixon supporters, also referred to as "bloodthirsty freaks"), all while an inebriated Thompson watches with juvenile glee.\n\nWhile critics and readers alike are split on the novel, most at least concede it is a scathing and effective critique of the current literary and political climate."

 novel.5.t:0 "The Red Twilight"
 novel.5.d:0 "Since the fall of London, novelist Eric Blair, better known by his pen name George Orwell, has gained prominence from his political writings done in exile in Canada. Today, he has released his most lengthy opus: the last chapter in his "Legacy of the Weltkrieg" alternate history series, "The Red Twilight". The series takes place in a timeline that diverges from ours with a Central Powers victory in the First World War, and has received critical attention for its allegorical deconstruction of our world.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Entente, the governments of the British Empire and France quickly collapse and are replaced by socialist republics, while Russia eventually becomes a fascistic dictatorship lead by White revolutionary Boris Savinkov. After unifying to destroy the German Empire, her allies, and the remnants of the Entente, the alliance quickly shatters, with the libertarian syndicalist Commune of France and Oswald Mosley's Union of Britain forging their own internationals and engaging in an apocalyptic nuclear war that leaves Europe and North America in ruins, while Russia and Japan engage in a similarly destructive schism. The world by 1962 is devastated by nuclear fallout and divided by a four-sided armistice threatening to either end civilization or enslave it under various flavours of totalitarianism.\n\nEnding with the 'English socialist' American Commonwealth tearing apart itself into a Third American Civil War as white supremacists revolt in the South, the novel has received analysis for its complex parallels with the violent conflicts occurring all around world, though some dismiss it as no different than the rest of the glut of alt-history novels that have been filling bookshelves in the recent years. Responding to critics, Orwell has addressed the implausibility of this universe by writing "... this universe is no less stranger than anything that has happened in ours for the last half-century.""

 novel.10.t:0 "Another Planet's Hell"
 novel.10.d:0 "The novel "Another Planet's Hell" has released today, giving its author, Aldous Huxley, quite the reputation for its themes and story. The book is set in an alternative reality, where Adolf Hitler dies during his attempted putsch in 1923 and never takes power, instead superseded by the monarchist DNVP and its leader, Alfred Hugenberg. In Russia, Nikolai Bukharin loses to Joseph Stalin, who centralizes power and creates an almost nightmarish dictatorship that strengthens the union. The Second World War is is started by the newly formed Deutsche Ordensstaat, a military junta backed by the Kaiser, and is led by Hugenberg, Erwin Rommel and Erich Ludendorff (in the book, the junta is called the Crusader's Council).\n\nThe book takes place during the war, in occupied France. Its protagonist, Anne-Marie Manouchian, starts as a college professor teaching chemistry, but becomes a bombmaker after the school is shut down and many of its professors arrested for promoting anti-German ideals. During her struggle, she meets the two other primary protagonists; Jack, an OSS agent helping the resistance, and Nikolai, a Soviet agent running guns to communist militias. As the story goes on, the three primary factions emerge; first, the Imperial Entente, a faction led by a more reactionary United Kingdom and a Bonapartist France. Second, the Alliance of Soviets, a Russia-led faction poised at spreading world communism. Finally, there exists the Pacific Joint-Defense Group, an alliance led by a more democratic Japan and the United States.\n\nThe book ends with Anne-Marie witnessing the nuclear bombing of the city of Dresden, while Nikolai says that "this is not an end, but a beginning to a world torn open by flame. Your children shall be communists, or you shall not have children." The book has been criticized by many as being overly pessimistic and heavy on details, but others have insisted that this could have been a reality had things played out differently. Huxley has defended the novel, saying that "as miserable as things are, we can at least be thankful for what could never happen.""

 novel.11.t:0 "The Blue Order"
 novel.11.d:0 "An intriguing work of fiction has been gaining traction around the world in the past few weeks. Said novel, titled "The Blue Order," authored under the pen name of "Miles Lloyd" depicts a world in which a radical, authoritarian politician runs for the American Presidency in 1932, associated with the revived "Bull Moose Party." This president, only known to readers as "the president," quickly proceeds to consolidate his power under the guise of defending America, and rapidly turns the American economy into one fueled by preparation for an 'eventual war'. With this in mind, he issues an ultimatum to Nazi Germany upon the remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936. Any further military movements will be met with swift American reprisal. Upon the Anschluss of Austria, the president declares war on Germany, under the guise of "safeguarding liberty".\n\nHistory is then lost in this world for two decades. Upon sunrise of some arbitrary day, the world is revealed to have been torn apart by a Second World War. In Russia, the Soviets have lost all of Eastern Siberia to the American Republic, while the death of Bukharin throws the remainder into chaos. In Asia, the State of Japan lies under American supervision, having lost against them prior. In Europe, the British Isles, Iberia, and Italy remain as the last major independent regions, having formed a strange alliance of democracy and fascism, with the Soviets being a previous member before Bukharin's death. In the remains of mainland Europe, American puppet 'republics' sit under lock and chain. American control is not absolute, however, with various warlord states waiting for the sunset to liberate their homelands.\n\nThe president cannot live forever, however, and upon his assassination at the end of the novel, the sun begins crossing the horizon, as the destiny of humanity hangs in the balance."

 novel.12.t:0 "The Occupation"
 novel.12.d:0 "A new book has been flying off the shelves across the world, circulating heavily even in the black markets of Germany. Entitled "The Occupation", the book describes an alternate history where the Germans are defeated in the Second World War. In it, Japan collapses into civil war with communists and lose their footholds on mainland Asia. Though the emperor eventually prevails, Japan never recovers and opts to lick its wounds rather than embark on the conquests it did in our world. Thus, once the Germans are pushing across England and the United States finally intervenes, they are not distracted by the fighting in the Pacific and manage to defeat and occupy Germany. The defeated Reich is split into two halves: the German People's Republic, a Soviet puppet state consisting of the north, and the Republic of Germany, an allied occupation zone with self-government consisting of the south, the Rhineland, and Austria. The two are more commonly known as North and South Germany in the story. Once again, a nationalist and revanchist government is elected in South Germany, similar to Hitler's rise in our own world. Having learned from the mistakes of the past, South Germany is quickly invaded and the old government reinstated by the Allies. The story follows a poor German youth who is believed to be a nationalist by the occupying Western powers. Although he isn't at the start of the book, his unjustified persecution by the occupiers eventually leads him to become one, and the book hints that this is part of an endless cycle that will always lead to oppression and violence by one side. It also hints that something similar and far more dangerous may occur with the now-recovered Japan.\n\nThe book has proven stunningly controversial. Many claim it is Nazi schlock, trying to clear them of wrongdoing and insinuating that their reaction to Versailles was justified. Others claim that it is simply unrealistic, and that Japan's communist movement would have never been strong enough to do the damage the book has them do. The author says they are all missing the point, and that the book is more about the message rather than the setting."

 novel.13.t:0 "SSR-Ostpreussen"
 novel.13.d:0 "This week, author Len Deighton published his newest novel, "SSR-Ostpreussen". The novel takes place in an alternate history where Mikhail Tukhachevsky launches a coup against Bukharin in the late 1920s, transforming the Soviet Union into a military state comparable to Napoleon's France. 'The New Bonaparte' as he is styled, launches numerous invasions of Eastern Europe and Scandinavia at a time when the rest of the world is still reeling from the Great Depression and unable to respond, significantly strengthening the Soviets' position. Hitler's Germany finds a much tougher opponent in this union and the war between the two lasts for many years, until both sides are forced into peace after each discovers the atomic bomb simultaneously and the cities of Königsberg and Kiev are annihilated.\n\nThe story focuses on a commissar of the Red Army who has been assigned to oversee the reconstruction of Soviet-held Königsberg, now rechristened Stalingrad after a close ally of Tukhachevsky. Upon discovering the murder of a prominent government official, the commissar finds himself embroiled in a byzantine web of plots involving the Soviet high command, the local garrison, and partisans from the heavily oppressed and radiation-scarred German inhabitants of the city. Hints are laid throughout the story of greater goings on behind the scenes, such as massive instability in German-controlled Western Europe and extensive Soviet military campaigns in Northern Iran and Western China. The story ends with the commissar narrowly escaping death at the hands of his superiors and uncovering a plot to provoke the Reich into a new war.\n\nThe book has drawn praised for its unique take on the noir genre and its gritty setting amidst the burned-out streets of Stalingrad. Some have criticised it for its somewhat sympathetic portrayal of the German characters, with a few even going as far as to suggest that Deighton may possess Nazi ideals. Regardless, it has already had a quite successful first run of sales and is expected to become a staple of alternate history for years to come."
