 PER_German_Persian_Oil_Company:0 "Deutsch-Persische Ölgesellschaft"
 PER_German_Persian_Oil_Company_desc:0 "Originally the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, ownership of the corporation was transferred to Germany during the division of the British Empire at the end of the Second World War. Rebranded as the Deutsch-Persische Ölgesellschaft (DPÖ), the Company controls every drop of oil in Iran and dictates what pittance of the profit we receive from its sales."
 PER_Mosaddeghs_Legacy:0 "Mosaddegh's Legacy"
 PER_Mosaddeghs_Legacy_desc:0 "Our nation still vividly remembers the 1953 Coup against the government of then Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. Orchestrated by Germany following Mosaddegh's nationalisation of the DPÖ, many both domestically and internationally view the coup as the death of Iranian democracy. With the installation of a Pro-German regime and the Shah greatly empowered, the trust between our government and the people will take a long time to heal, should it ever heal at all."
 PER_The_Imperial_Guard:0 "The Imperial Guard"
 PER_The_Imperial_Guard_desc:0 "Fiercely loyal to the Shah, the Imperial Guard are the most elite combat units in the Middle East. Acting as the Shah's personal guard and serving as an elite branch of the army, many of our nation's finest soldiers come from its ranks. With some of the most modern equipment, harshest training and strictest recruitment tests in the world they are the true heirs to the Persian Immortals of old."
 PER_The_Iranian_Civil_War:0 "The Iranian Civil War"
 PER_The_Iranian_Civil_War_desc:0 "Iran is in chaos. Scores of men, women and children die every day in combat and in the crossfire. The divisions of this ancient society will be made whole through blood, and only then perhaps will the Iranian people know peace. But is it all worth it?"

 ## Leader Bios ##
 POLITICS_MOHAMMAD_REZA_PAHLAVI_DESC:0 "Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ascended to the Iranian throne in 1941, his father forced into abdication during an abortive invasion from the Soviet Union and British Empire. International scholars have since argued that this was when the Shah first became sympathetic to the German Reich, two great empires bullied by the old European empires.\n\nThe decades since his ascension to the throne have seen the relationship between the Shah and his German friends grow ever closer, Germany making every effort to begin bringing Iran into their sphere following the war with all manner of recovery aid, international loans and military advisors. It was a relationship which was exposed to the world in August 1953 with the German orchestrated coup against then Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh and the installation of a firmly pro-German government, with the Shah greatly empowered and openly welcoming the German Reich into Iran.\n\nYet whilst the Shah may now enjoy the power and luxuries worthy of a true monarch, to say that the ground beneath him is shaky would be a great understatement. Having lost the trust of the populace, the Iranian people take to the streets to demand all manner of reform, with an influx of German racial theory inflaming all manner of racial conflicts within Iran. So too have his German benefactors began to demand reform, preferring a more liberal Iran which may remain in their Sphere to one aflame. Now with the 2,500th anniversary of the Iranian monarchy imminent, the Shah is determined to ensure it can last for 2,500 years more."
 POLITICS_FARAH_PAHLAVI_DESC:0 "Farah Pahlavi is the Shahbanu, Empress of the Imperial State of Iran. As a daughter to wealthy parents Farah's upbringing was a privileged one, full of opportunities that common Iranians could only dream of. She met the Shah as a student of architecture in the Reich, and they were married in an opulent ceremony which caused her country's Treasury some strain. For ten years and more the Shah ruled over Iran, and Farah enjoyed all the glamour and luxury that was due the Empress. She was not idle during this time, working to improve the lot of Iranian women and fostering cultural initatives.\n\nThen her world was set aflame. With her husband's death Farah Pahlavi became Regent of the Imperial State, watching her country collapse into civil war. The Shahbanu is known to favour the German language over Persian; more importantly, she represents an establishment dedicated to German-Iranian friendship, and the continued provision of oil to the Reich.\n\nNow the Empress presides over a throne stained in blood, as German guns and German bombers reduce her country to rubble. To the Generals and SAVAK men who support her regency, the Empress is a stabilising figure, the last hope that the 2500 year monarchy will survive. The Empress herself can only watch as §Rmore and more people are butchered in her name§!."
 POLITICS_SHAPOUR_BAKHTIAR_DESC:0 "Shapour Bakhtiar has never asked for much from his opponents. Where the other claimants to Iranian leadership have denounced the Shah, Bakhtiar sought only to keep the monarchy in place with a constitution. For every call for blood he has called for moderation, reconciliation, and peace. For this many of the Iranian people revile him as an apologist for tyranny. They could not be more wrong.\n\nFor Bakhtiar has more than earned his stripes as a freedom fighter. During the Spanish Civil War, he had fought on the side of the ill-fated Republic. When the Germans subdued France, Bakhtiar used his contacts among the French Resistance to undermine the occupier. Now Bakhtiar fights for his own country, and he is determined that he shall not fight for the losing side another time. All he has ever wanted is for his people to be free, and to be led by a good man towards this goal. Only death will stop him."
 POLITICS_SHER_MOHAMMED_MARRI_DESC:0 "Sher Mohammed is a Marri chief of Baluchestan. As leader of the Baluchi Liberation Front, he has pioneered guerilla warfare against all those who would encroach on the independence of the Baluch. A proud Sunni people in a nation of Shia, with their own language, culture and tradition, the millions of Baluchi have long been ruled by people who do not understand them. To this nationalist motivation Sher Mohammed adds a Marxist interpretation, seeing his people's struggle as yet another in the eternal fight against the oppressor.\n\nPerhaps their fight is doomed to failure from the beginning. The enemy has overwhelming superiority in both men and arms. It matters not. They will pay with blood for every inch of these mountains.""

 PER_GER.1.d:0 "Shahbanu Pahlavi,\n\nWe know the enemy coalition amassed against you is tremendous, and that you are outnumbered. In this vital hour, you can not under any circumstances lose faith and give in to foreign and domestic pressures! You must stand your ground; even in the face of such opposition.\n\nOur government is mobilizing aid, including men, as you read this. The first wave of Wehrmacht volunteers should be arriving shortly, followed by a steady stream of supplies. Until then, the Imperial army must hold its favorable positions. The enemy alliance arrayed against you is fragil; time is against them. Their unity will waver, sooner or later. Until that time arrives, we will stand by you in your hour of need."
