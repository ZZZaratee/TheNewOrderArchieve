 #Leader Descriptions
 POLITICS_FEDERICO_GOMEZ_DESC:0 "Commander Federico Gómez de Salazar was a natural choice to lead the Iberian "peacekeeping" mission into Algeria. Born in 1912, Gómez de Salazar grew up during the interwar years in Spain, watching as the country became ever more divided and unstable despite its safety from the ravages of the First World War. By 1929 he was training under General Francisco Franco at the General Military Academy in Zaragoza. Naturally he fought for the Nationalist cause during the Spanish Civil War. In the Second World War he was a member of the División Azul, the Spanish volunteer division deployed on the Eastern Front for the German Reich on behalf of the Franco regime. Following the war, Gómez continued to serve dutifully under the newly formed Iberian Union.\n\nThe troubles in Algeria were hardly unknown to the Caudillos of Iberia. Salazar in particular was eager to protect the substantial Iberian settler population living along the Algerian-Moroccan border. When the situation in Algeria got unstable enough, Salazar seized upon the chance to deploy the army. Gómez de Salazar's orders were concise: protect all Iberian settlers, cooperate with the French Pied-Noirs, and eliminate Italian influence. Gómez de Salazar is a loyal officer - once he has received his order, he will carry them out, whatever they may be."

 SLG_Legion_Presence_desc:0 "The Spanish Legion was sent in to protect its Portuguese brothers as they resettled into the land. Most importantly, however, they were deployed to govern the territory in the absence of French authority. It remains the predominant political and military force in the area, and controls much of what happens in the region..."
 SLG_Retornados:0 "Portuguese Retornados"
 SLG_Retornados_desc:0 "In the wake of the German invasion of Portuguese Africa, many of our citizens chose to return to Iberian territory. Thus, the government decided to place them in the unofficially Iberian-controlled region of Algeria as part of a scheme to reinforce their claims over the territory. To this day, Portuguese settlers inhabit the territory, providing us a base to work towards a stronger nation."
 SLG_Native_Unrest:0 "Native Unrest"
 SLG_Native_Unrest_desc:0 "With the overwhelming number of Portuguese settling in the territory, native Algerians have decided to protest the actions of the regime and give us a headache overall. It is a problem that must be dealt with one way or another..."
