 ### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_ANTIPIN_DESC: "Mikhail Ivanovich Antipin was originally a humble farmer from Chelyabinsk, one who focused more on day-to-day survival instead of education or philosophical matters. When duty - and the draft - called, he ended up in the infantry as a machine gunner, fighting mostly on the Ukrainian front. He was a rather prolific soldier, even being considered for the Hero of the Soviet Union award at one point. He never was properly honored, however, because the government collapsed shortly after. His brigade fell to infighting, and he fled with nothing but the clothes on his back.\n\nAfter wandering through the wilderness for over a month, Antipin came upon the town of Gayny, where a local priest took him in and nursed him back to health. In the meantime, Antipin had something of a religious awakening, realizing that all these terrible tragedies that shook Russia - the incompetence of the Tsars, the Germans, the October Revolution, the tyranny of the Soviets, the famines, the Germans once more - were not happenstance, but punishments. The people of Russia had forsaken the Lord, so He brought retribution upon them for their sins.\n\nThis revelation brought a new purpose to Antipin's life. He rallied men from Gayny and the surrounding villages of the Gayny District beneath the banner of what they called the "Order of Saint George", promising to "impale the dragon of atheism upon the lance of truth." The Order is fairly small, but they provide stability and spiritual encouragement for the people of the district, and have proven rather effective at keeping the madmen and heathens surrounding them at bay. Grand Master Mikhail only kneels before God and refuses to suborn the Order to any mortal ruler, but if he discovers a leader who he finds to be sufficiently pious, he will gladly pledge himself and his men to its cause."

 POLITICS_YAKOV_PENTELEEV_DESC: "Yakov Elizarovich Panteleyev is a veteran of more wars than most. Born in a village of Udmurtia, he was a farmer until he was drafted into the Red Army mere days after the start of the Great Patriotic War. He bravely defended cities far from his homeland in the Idel-Ural, which earned him many medals and promotions, and fought until the Germans reached the banks of the Volga, and all hope was lost. Still a patriot at heart, Panteleyev volunteered to join a unit of ethnic Udmurts in the West Russian War, but once again, Russia faced defeat at the hands of the Wehrmacht, and from there the officer faded into obscurity.\n\nThat was, until the Anti-Communist Guard reigned supreme over northwestern Russia and authority in the Volga region collapsed. As a respected army commander, Yakov was unanimously elected by a hurriedly formed local council as the new President of the Udmurt Republic, in association with the Northern Russian Republic as a loyal ally.\n\nFor the first time, Panteleyev's people have a nation for themselves, and he would like to keep it that way."

 GAY_warrior_order: "Warrior Order"
 GAY_warrior_order_desc: "For centuries, Russia was the defender of the One, Holy and Catholic and Apostolic Church, but the Tsars have grown lax in their duty, and the Lord struck them down, sending pestilence over pestilence over our land as punishment for their decadence. But we, the Order of Saint George, have understood that the Salvation of Russia lies in returning to Russia's roots as a land of faith, and by reviving the Faith we will gain the favor of the Lord; and with His Favor comes the fortitude necessary to smite all enemies and reclaim Russia from the invaders and from the Red Scourge of Communism."
 
 ### Events ###
 GAY.1.t: "A Day In The Life"
 GAY.1.desc: "The day of Epistolary Daniil began two hours before dawn. Members of the night patrol rang their bells in the mess halls, carrying lanterns and awakening the warrior-monks. They donned the inner cassock in a few moments, and the chaplain led the Morning Prayer. It was a simple prayer, as ostentation did not endear men to divinity. All done, the chaplain divided the day's duties and administered the Communion, for it was Sunday. After that, he left the monks to pray, prepare, and dress as their tasks demanded of them. Daniil was to train, to pray, and to perform duties befitting an Epistolary. He issued a silent amen.\n\nIn a few moments, the morning patrol departed. After breakfast, Daniil was now in combat gear, leading his men through the war-games. He guessed that an Epistolary was equivalent to a sergeant, and he felt that he did well coordinating and commanding his squad in executing tasks throughout the field. A lucky shot took him out, and he watched in dismay as his fellows fell into disarray. Practice over, they would have lunch, and he spent the afternoon secluded in meditation. He was released just in time for the evening to sweep Russia, and thus dinner to be served. Bellies full, they would start to other tasks. For others, it would mean patrols or studies of saints. For Daniil, it was something else.\n\nHe opened the door to the scriptorium and lit a candle. It would reveal the inkpots and pens, pages and pages of parchment and paper, and volumes bound in jeweled and gilded leather covers. It was his home. Tonight, too, he would do his task with joy. He drew a sheet of parchment and opened a volume, and started copying. He whispered a silent prayer in his heart, and whether or not God existed, he no longer cared. The truth was that faith behooved men to great acts, and he thanked the Lord for what he was given today. At midnight, he would quit his task, and join the night prayer, before going to bed."
 GAY.1.a: "Just another day in the monastery."
