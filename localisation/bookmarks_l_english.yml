 THENEWORDER_NAME:0 "The New Order"
 THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "With the triumph of the Axis over the Allied powers, a New Order has descended upon the world. In the places of Union Jack and the Hammer and Sickle now soar the Rising Sun and Swastika. A single light flickers desperately against the night in the United States; Germany celebrates the first man on the moon as Europe chafes; and Japan lines its pockets as China's slumber slowly breaks. The Mediterranean lies on a knife's edge, and what remains of Russia prepares to realize its destiny."

 USA_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "While America joined the Second World War, it was too late. The United States performed admirably, humbling the Kriegsmarine in the Atlantic and beginning to turn the tide in the Pacific, but the invention of the atom bomb ended any hopes of American victory for those few remaining Allies.\n\nNow, twenty years later, America stands divided. While the depression is slowly ending, the American political scene sits in chaos. The government remains locked between the uneasy Republican-Democrats and the National Progressive Party, a failing union of America's political outcasts. With the Civil Rights movement greatly shifting the political sphere, the 60's will herald the greatest threats America has ever faced."
 CAN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "In the wake of the fall of Britain the Canadians turned their heads to their southern neighbors for leadership and guidance, even as the Royal Family settled in Ottawa. Rising from the shadows of George Drew's conservative political machine, Lester Pearson and his Liberal Party have risen through snap elections to stand at the helm of a nation struggling to define itself. Constitutional monarchy or a free republic? British, French, Quebecois, or all of the above, or none? Is the nation forever doomed to be an appendage of US foreign policy? What can be done about the increasingly virulent separatism afflicting Quebec? In the uncertainty, one thing is certain: Canada must stand together, both within and without, or the land that stretches from sea to sea will quickly find itself becalmed by currents it cannot withstand."
 CUB_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Socialism and freedom from foreign domination. These were the values Fidel Castro fought for against the government of Fulgencio Batista- at least until he received an offer from the CIA. In exchange for covert support in overthrowing the worryingly pro-German Batista, Castro would refrain from advocating revolution or anti-Americanism in the Western Hemisphere and allow American corporate investment into Cuba. Although it angered communist hardliners, the deal allowed Castro's socialist revolutionaries to sweep into power. But as hardliners plot to expel the CIA's influence from Cuba, and as opposition builds in the States to this bastion of communism so close to American shores, who knows how long this will last?"
 ICE_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "It's become something of a joke, that Iceland is as free a nation as Greenland is green.\n\nWhile ostensibly independent, the presence of the United States military is felt everywhere. Bases dot the island and nearly as many of its inhabitants live in a military base as outside of them. While at first the arrival of American troops was seen as a positive mark, a sure sign of the nation's continued freedom against German rule in Europe, this has quickly turned against the Americans. Now seeing as occupiers and with unrest growing, the US holds onto the island ever harder, fearing a soft German coup in the northern Atlantic."
 AST_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Australia- a continent, an island, and a country, located on the edge of the world. Sitting just below Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere, it either narrowly avoided or repelled invasion in the Second World War, depending on who you ask. In the years after, Australian society, encouraged by their American allies, became more and more militarized to ward off the looming Japanese threat, even as the Sphere pulled back towards defending what it had already gained. Postwar Australian politics came to be dominated by two political blocs- the conservative coalition between the United Australia Party and Australian Country Party, and the Australian Labour Party. The two would spar on issues from Australia's military involvement to the controversial White Australia Policy, and as further conflicts flare up around the globe, who will come out on top?"
 NZL_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "New Zealand is a small island nation on the periphery of the world, often forgotten among the superpower politics of Washington and Tokyo. However, for New Zealanders, superpower politics could not be closer to home. Thousands of New Zealanders fought the Japanese in the Second World War, many of them perishing in the process. After the war ended, its scars remained, with New Zealand facing demographic damage, lost trade partners, economic crisis, and an increasingly pushy America using the nation's islands as bases for its military transport to Australia. Although the conservative National Party has managed to steer the ship of state thus far, for how long will they be able to maintain their strength?"
 SAF_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "A monarchy without a monarch and a nation without direction, the Union of South Africa has found itself increasingly struggling to hold back the forces of unrest waiting to tear the nation asunder.\n\nWhile the Boers have never managed to take power in the nation, their presence is felt as more and more they clamor for either representation or outright independence. Elsewhere, the Africans shout from the streets against a nation of segregation, if not in law than in practice. If its domestic issues were not enough, South Africa finds itself torn between two spheres, constantly being pressured by the Americans to join the OFN and the Germans to bow to the Reich."
 GUY_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As German panzers rolled along Downing Street, British Guiana suddenly found itself free of Imperial influence, and from the ashes of the war, the Republic of Guyana was born. Not all is fine in the Republic, however. Hers is a story told far too often throughout history; a feeble nation used and shackled down to suffer. Their own beloved President, Cheddi Jagan, was voted out and exiled by a CIA-rigged election in the 50's.\n\nGuyana's new president inspires not hope, but fear. Forbes Burnham an iron-fisted strongman, and under his leadership, the liberties of Guyanans grow weaker with each passing day. Strict racial segregation laws have been introduced, restricting the rights of Indo-Guyanans. Will Burnham continue to strike down his opponents? Or will Guyana break her chains and be freed?"
 BRA_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Brazil is a land of contrasts: it has a booming economy, but poverty is everywhere. It remains in cold war with the African Reichskommissariats, but is not involved with the OFN embargo against Japan. A state which is a liberal democracy, but where countless remain disenfranchised.\n\nBrazil's economy will continue growing as long as the trade continues, but its politics are on a knife-edge. While Brazil's future looks bright, those in power know that it could all come tumbling down at a moment's notice."
 SCO_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Republic of Scotland came about when Scottish nationalists and remnants of the British military successfully used the abolition of the monarchy as a fig leaf to keep the Germans away. In the twenty years since then, Scotland has continued its existence as a reasonably stable but paranoid republic forced to confront issues of Scottish nationalism, English refugees, and the ever-present military influence on politics. As the British Isles collapse into instability, the decisions of Scotland are certain to affect the way things develop as the New Order fades away."

 BRT_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Brittany owes much to the hun.\n\nWhile the nation claims to be a proud member of the Einheitspakt, in reality Brittany is the greatest thorn in the alliance's side. The largest black market in Europe, some have called Brittany the 'syndicate with a state'. Seeing the amassing of wealth and the weakening of the Pakt as its best chance to ensure domestic stability and keep itself protected, Brittany's only interest in the Pakt is how long it can use it to stave off the looming threat of Burgundy. There are those, however, scorned old friends of President Mordrel, who believe new direction is necessary on the peninsula."
 MAD_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Madagaskar is falling down.\n\nThe garrison seems to be increasingly paranoid and ever crueler in its attempts to prove itself as true children of Germany despite their blood and pasts. The Jewish, a leftover from a time when Germany hoped it could simply remove its Untermensch by shipping them overseas, have increasingly begun calling the nation their 'Israel' and the insurgency has proven both bloody and nearly impossible for the garrison to contain. When these two groups are not causing trouble, the rising tides of African nationalism has also brought the natives up in arms. While this all threatens to tear the nation apart, Reichskommissar Maurice sits in his office, quietly committing treason."
 GGN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 ""Germanization is at an all time high! Dissent is at an all time low! Poland is pacified, hell, it mind as well be named Southern Prussia!"\n\nThis sentence was the first in one of the many reports Hans Frank has sent to the Reichstag, as he has done dutifully for over a decade. On paper, his rule is the strongest and most impressively done in the Reich, having followed Nazi policy to a T and done so with the finesse and ability of the greatest of politicians. In reality, Poland is a collapsing mess, and in shadows and sewer tunnels, the resistance waits for the German grip to slip..."
 OST_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The crown jewel in the Nazi crown, Ostland is seen as the model colony for all German administrators to follow.\n\nGermanization in Ostland is the highest in the Reich, its industrial and rural production is reaching all time highs, and Reichskommissar Lohse has taken the first steps towards signing a permanent ceasefire with several of the largest partisan groups in the nation.\n\nOf course, as Lohse ails and the homeland falls, one must wonder what will happen to the colony that has so closely modeled itself after its master..."
 MCW_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Kasche sits on a throne of failure. Oddly enough, this has given him great success, just not in the eyes of the Reich.\n\nOnce a staunch proponent of hardline Nazism, his near death at the hands of partisans during the West Russian War has left him as a shell. Now he merely presides over Moskowien with the lightest of hands, hoping to merely prevent more bloodshed from consuming the colony and possibly reaching himself. Every report he sends to Germany, brutally honest with how little progress Germanization has had, is another step towards the firing line. But as the Reich seems to be crumbling, Kasche has already prepared for the inevitabilities. Still, one must wonder what will happen without the colony's apathetic leadership..."
 ENG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Although American aid came to the English in the World War, it was too late, and for the first time, England was invaded by a foreign power. Her empire stripped away, and with an occupation force ensuring 'good order and civility' of the English people, England now faces its darkest hour, with no Arthur to save it. If anything can be said of the British however, it is that they are hard headed, and even now, twenty years later, whispers of rebellion spread.\n\nThe nation now sits on a tipping point, collaborate with the wicked Hun, or risk everything to stop them?"
 BRG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Much of northern France remained under direct German occupation when the Second World War ended. Life there was cruel and oppressive, but eventually settled into something resembling normalcy. But it would not last. After his failed coup during the West Russian War, Heinrich Himmler was given northern France and Belgium as his fiefdom by Hitler, hoping it would leave him content to no longer meddle in German politics. But what was meant to be a sinecure became a staging ground. The land of the nascent SS-Ordensstaat Burgund is clay in Himmler's hands, free for him to mold as he sees fit. And with his plans growing more audacious and destructive by the day, the \"Shadow State\" will soon play host to greater and greater dangers to the Reich, Europe, and eventually the world."
 GER_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Once humbled by their failures in the Weltkrieg, Germany once more rose to prominence with the leadership of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. Thanks to the failures of the Allies, WW2 has ended in complete German victory.\n\nGermany now presides over the most powerful Empire on Earth, but despite her victory, Germany's control remains tenuous at best. Wracked by an economic crash that has frozen the nation for a decade, and with a massive slave caste providing for the German people, the population has began to protest. The nation is now trapped in a series of student protests and the machinations of the Reichsbank."
 CZE_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Bohemia should have been part of the Reich by now, but not all things are meant to be.\n\nWhile the protectorate was well on its way towards integration in the 50s, the rapid deterioration of the Reich's power soon put all of these plans on hold.\n\nDespite this, Bohemia ran as normal, before oddly enough the resistance seemed to reappear. Once small cells apparently doubled and tripled in size almost overnight, and the garrison now struggles to hold the line. One can only wonder who would possibly raise so much trouble behind the shadows."
 CRN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The brave sons of Germany watch eternal. Their charge? All of England for the security of the Fatherland. Only the finest soldiers can find posting in the Cornwall Governorate, the center of operations for the entirety of the garrison of occupied England. Having been proven right in Halder's insistence that the English would never peacefully aid in Germany's unification of Europe after their unsuccessful rebellion in the 50s, the garrison now stands on the alert at all times, prepared to do battle for the prosperity of the Pakt.\n\nWords muttered under quiet breaths speak of Germany facing its twilight, and if such a time would come, the Garrison must be ready to do whatever it must do for the homeland. The isles will be secure!"
 ANG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The pilots of Reichskommissariat Südwestafrika rule the skies even while Africa remains locked in chaos. From the airstrips of Angola, hundreds of German bombers filter in and out en-route to bomb West Africa into the dust. From his squadron headquarters, Reichskommissar Schenck rules, treating the natives with a light hand and his duties even more lightly, many have criticized his hands off attitude and apparent disregard to actually rule the nation.\n\nTo Schenck, however, only the skies can provide him solace from the hell that he had a hand in creating, and some whisper that the Reichskommissar is not entirely loyal to the Reich, but from all reports, Schenck remains as loyal as he has ever been, a model hero of German aviation."
 GRO_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Some say that each Reichskommissariat is but a mirror of its ruler. Indeed, Ostafrika is very similar to Reichskommissar Hans Hüttig: both are dry, pitiless and utterly devoid of humanity.\nUnder the watchful eye of their Aryan masters, the inferiors toil, their blood, their tears and their deaths nothing but the perfect fuel for the Reich. Even the watchers, however, are under scrutiny: Hüttig despises incompetence and pity, and will crush anyone displaying said defects. What awaits his enemies is a lifetime of suffering, where even death is a luxury.\nIn a world of degenerates and traitors, Hans Hüttig will uphold the Aryan standard, no matter the odds, no matter the means, no matter the price."
 COG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Covered by a lush jungle and filled with wildlife that would make all hunters weep in joy, the former Belgian Congo is the richest of all the German colonies. Under the perfect façade, however, lies a dangerous world, far more dangerous than any safari may be.\nReichskommissar Siegfried Müller spends his days hunting, neglecting the administration, and the entire colony has been turned into a private business for the many corporations, both German and foreign, lusting after Zentralafrika's resources.\nHowever, despite being a seasoned hunter, Müller might find himself prey to far larger predators: there are dangers lurking in the jungles, and sometimes, ink and paper can cause more slaughter and suffering than any set of fangs."
 CAU_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Reichskommissariat Kaukasien was originally meant to be a \"model colony\" of sorts, one where the natives would live peacefully under the Reich's watchful eye. The natives, of course, had different ideas. When the West Russian War broke out, the \"Transcaucasian Soviet\" launched a mass rebellion, besieging the capital of Tiflis and almost linking up with the Red Army. They were defeated, but it was clear that a firmer hand was needed. Enter Josias, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont. He was renowned for his methodical efficiency, but after being captured and tortured by Transcaucasian partisans, he also became known for his methodical extermination of rebels. The Reich doesn't bother him as long as the oil flows, but they fail to notice that his loyalties may lie elsewhere..."
 IRE_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Ireland's entry into the Second World War ensured its territorial unification, but it came at a cost.\n\nThroughout the 1950's, Ireland attached itself ever closer to the seemingly prosperous German Reich, adopting its military as a model, and its companies as sources of revenue. This close attachment has meant that Ireland went down with the sinking ship that was the German economy. While extremism on both sides of the isle rose since the crash, Éamon de Valera's successor, Seán Lemass, took the necessary steps to protect Irish democracy and independence, at the great expense of individual freedoms.\n\nMeanwhile, Ireland's northern counties, ruled by Neil Blaney, appear more unstable by the day, and its mismanagement could well prove the final nail in democracy's coffin."
 NOR_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As Reichskommissariat Moskowien is the jewel of the east, Reichskommissariat Norwegen is the gem of the west, and one which the SS and NSDAP saw as nothing less than the birthplace of the Aryan race; the invaluable addition to the German racial stock that knew no bounds in wealth, or resources.\n\nThroughout the early 1950's onwards, the SS established Norway as a paradise for the Aryan race, with Reichskommissar Josef Terboven finding himself in the company of none other than Josef Goebbels and Hans Hüttig, leading the colony headfirst into a policy of perpetuating the Aryan farmer-warrior. As time passed, it seemed as though Reichskommissar Terboven would be the first to fully Germanize a slice of the Reich. Such was never meant to be, however. The first strike to Terboven's destiny was from that of Himmler himself, pulling strings to send Hans Hüttig to Reichskommissariat Ostafrika, depriving Terboven of his most able SS ally. Then Goebbels, a close ally now beyond comparison, was murdered in the wilderness of Reichskommissariat Moskowien. The final nail in the coffin for Terboven's ambitions came in the shape of Heydrich Himmler's attempted coup, forcing all of the SS away from the stage of German politics.\n\nAs the dust settled from the purges of the SS, Terboven was horrified to find his position solidifying as one of isolation from ideological guidance or any substantial allies to speak of. Now, with political turmoil polarizing German society, and the Norwegian civilian populace growing rebellious, there seems to be little which can be done for Reichskommissariat Norwegen."
 WAL_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Republic of Wales' existence was not brought about due to a revival of Welsh nationalist sentiment in the region as the British Isles fell to the German jackboot. Quite the opposite, in fact: it was a puppet sliced off of the former United Kingdom to cripple England, and that fact looms large over it to this day. What prosperity it has is predicated upon its coal mines, and in the meantime the country struggles with the incessant conflict between nationalists and unionists that has marked it from day one of its existence. Time will tell what happens and who wins out."

 JAP_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The sun never sets on the Japanese Empire, or at least it hasn't yet. Reigning over the single largest population of any nation on Earth, the Japanese maintain the largest military, industrial base, and navy in the world. With treaty ports in America and ownership of the Pacific, Japan has gone from a shut in nation behind the Europeans to the masters of the sea and land. All is not well, however, as the increasingly byzantine Imperial Court constantly undermines the monarchy, and the more Japan uses China's resources, the more their grip on the colonies slip."
 
## NEUTRAL ##
 IBR_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "With Germany victorious in the Second World War, many expected Spain to rise alongside it. When Spain refused to bend to the will of Germany however tensions soon began to rise. The Germans finally demanded they bend to their demands to build the Dam of Gibraltar, which the Spanish finally relented to.\n\nThis led to chaos however as the Atlantropa plan failed, and as Germany confiscated Portugal's Africa colonies and began sabre rattling against their southern neighbors, Portugal and Spain agreed to unification to better hold off German invasion. This invasion never came however, and now the two rest uneasily with one another. As German might fades into the past, so too does this uncomfortable union..."

 #Southern Urals
 MGN_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Trofim Lysenko leads his clique of scientist from atop the Black Mountain, reigning over his people as a dictator. Helped by the NKVD, Lysenko abducts unknowing Russians for testing, attempting to create a super soldier able to finally drive the Germans out of Russia. His pseudoscientific beliefs and army of scientists make him one of the most feared rulers in the Urals, second only to the Black Bandit himself. Magnitogorsk has come to be content with his iron rule, and if Lysenko can keep the NKVD in check, he will reign for years to come..."

 ORE_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Orenburg and the surrounding areas were spared the chaos brought on by the end of the USSR. Lacking any major industrial centers or natural resources, local villages soon returned to a way of life centered around land, family, church and village. In time Orenburg emerged as a neutral ground where peasants and workers of the region could trade and live in peace. The city, mostly ignored by German bombers, was left free to prosper; peasants began exchanging their crops for tools and supplies, creating a blossoming economy. Soon rumors spread of an oasis of peace, south of the Urals. However, not all is well for the young Workers' State. As threats loom on the horizon, Orenburg will have to react to the onslaught brought on by the foes on the border. How much freedom will Orenburg be forced to give up, in order to survive?"

 DRL_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Oskar Dirlewanger and his Black Brigade terrorize the Southern Urals, plundering anything of value, raping and brutalizing the women they capture, and killing anyone who resists them. Countless destroyed settlements dot the land, victims of attacks in the night, of vicious sackings, and of razings executed for no reason other than bloodlust.\n\nDead at the feet of Dirlewanger and the other monsters of the Brigade are men, women, and children uncountable. Those who resisted them. Those who questioned them. Those who doubted them. Those they simply didn't like. Rivers of blood, misery, and destruction flow outward from the Brigade, and show no signs of stopping anytime soon."

 URL_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Vorkuta has always been cold and unforgiving, which made it the perfect place to put enemies of the Soviet Union. After the chaos of the German Invasion, however, the gulags which housed those prisoners were abandoned. Due to the influence of Father Janis Mendriks, the guards and their captives put aside their differences and united for survival. They traveled a Long March south before establishing themselves in a network of mountain fortresses. This coalition of military outposts came to be known as the Ural League, and with the Southern Urals being one of the most dangerous places in Russia, the League have become the protectors of the region by default. Now, they face the greatest foes they have ever dealt with since the German invasion. Will the Guard stand strong, or will it crumble and leave the innocents of the region defenseless?"
 
 #West Russia
 VYT_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As the West Russian Revolutionary Front surged toward Moskau, the Germans were desperate for assistance to halt their advance. They found that in Vladimir Romanov, rightful heir to the Russian Empire, who had long dreamed of retaking his shattered homeland.\n\nPermitted to assemble a division of Russian exiles and volunteers, Vladimir was able to participate in the counteroffensive against the Revolutionary Front. Unexpectedly for the Germans, however, when the Revolutionary front began to collapse and the Wehrmacht's own offensive stalled, Vladimir's did not, advancing to and seizing control of the lands around Vyatka.\n\nEstablishing a pocket of monarchist rule, Tsar Vladimir III now rules as a reluctant autocrat while preparing to retake and restore the rest of the nation, knowing that it will take a strong hand to reunite Russia but hoping that his subjects will eventually have a voice in their government.\n\nThe Imperial state faces many challenges, including bickering generals, rival political cliques, and even questions of his own role and purpose in the government. Very soon the time will arrive when these questions will have to be answered, and the fate of both the Romanovs, and the Russian Empire, decided for all."
 
 KOM_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed at the end of the West Russian War, it was in Syktyvkar, capital of the Komi ASSR, that the civilian government of the Front found themselves in. From the witches' brew of WRRF officials, Soviet political exiles, refugees, and those who would be unwelcome in other statelets, the Komi Republic took form, establishing a constitution and democratic institutions which served to end the cycles of violence which had afflicted it.\n\nHowever, all is not well in the Republic - political conflict and scheming is reaching a crisis point, and it seems that the days of this democracy are limited."
 
 PRM_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Alexey Dobrovolsky was once just like any other Slav, weak and cowardly, blindly following the orders of his superiors in the West Russian Revolutionary Front. It was not until he was sent to die in battle against the Germans that he saw what true strength looked like. He saw mighty Aryan warriors smashing the weak Russians who dared oppose them, demonstrating the superiority of the master race. While the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed around him, Alexey had an epiphany: Aryanism is not physical. It is psychological, and those who are worthy of becoming Übermensch can ascend to join the master race by casting aside their old, inferior cultures. Alexey Dobrovolsky died that day. Gutrum Vagner and the Aryan Brotherhood were born.\n\nMen fleeing from the Red Army flocked to join the brotherhood, drawn by its promises of enlightenment and a new dawn for a stronger Russia. Eventually Vagner's followers grew into the thousands, and the Fyurer declared it was time for the master race to conquer the east once and for all. The Brotherhood stormed into Perm, capturing the city and declaring the birth of a new Reykh. Since then they have expanded to the south and west, enslaving thousands of subhumans and uplifting anyone they find that is worthy of joining the ranks of the Übermensch. The Fyurer is not content with mindless raiding and pillaging, as fun as it is. He has far greater plans for the Brotherhood, plans that will be set in motion soon."
 
 SAM_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Born of hazy post-war plans, the Russian Liberation Army, or ROA, was envisioned as nothing more than a collaborator militia writ large. Led by General Vlasov and a collection of turncoat Red Army officers, the ROA was meant to help legitimize German control of RK Moskowien until the Russians could be driven further east or exterminated.\n\nThe West Russian War in the fifties changed all of this. Expanded by the desperate Germans and deployed to delay the resurgent Red Army, the ROA thrived against all odds and soon found itself pushing east. By the war's end, Vlasov and his men controlled a power base beyond the Reich's grasp. Written off as mutinous rabble, the ROA has spent the intervening years waiting. Some hope for redemption; the others merely await the opportunity to carve an empire in Western Russia and beyond."
 
 WRS_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As the Soviet Union burned, its loyal Red Army refused to yield to the German invaders. In the dark days after the Union's collapse, Marshal Kliment Voroshilov rallied the surviving troops, and founded the West Russian Revolutionary Front to carry on the struggle against fascism. Striking back at the occupiers, the Front was at the cusp of victory when they were driven back at the last minute, nearly shattering it permanently.\n\nYet the Front lives on. From the city of Arkhangelsk, its grizzled veterans stand at the ready, preparing for the time when they drive the fascists from the Motherland and rebuild the Soviet Union anew. However, Voroshilov is not a young man, and his final hour draws close every day. It is a moment his generals are eagerly waiting for, each of them planning to seize his torch for themselves that they be the one who shall lead the Front to victory..."

 #West Siberia
 TYM_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Russia was a land of battling cliques long before the Soviet Union fell to the Germans. In the chaotic days after Lenin's death multiple successors vied for control over the young Union. For a brief moment it appeared as though the crown might pass to Joseph Stalin, but tragedy struck. Stalin met with a mysterious and untimely demise, and his supporters were scattered across the Union, relegated to positions of no importance as Bukharin secured control. One of those men sent to Siberia was Lazar Kaganovich, and he never forgot the teachings of his mentor. When the Union collapsed under the weight of the German invasion, Kaganovich was quick to act. Securing the support of Field Marshal Rokossovsky and Lieutenant-General Karbyshev, he took control of a massive stretch of territory from the Urals to Omsk. Kaganovich proclaimed the West Siberian People's Republic and prepared to retake the Union.\n\nIt was not meant to be. Both of his allies soon distanced themselves from Kaganovich, eventually breaking away entirely. Rokossovsky seized Sverdlovsk and the Republic's northern territories, While Karbyshev's Black League took the city of Omsk and its surroundings. Now Kaganovich is left ruling a fraction of his former territory from the city of Tyumen. Most men in his situation would have given up, but Kaganovich is made of stronger stuff. Soon his armies will march north and south, annihilating the traitors and reclaiming the Republic. Kaganovich is determined to reunite the Soviet Union and avenge himself and his old mentor, the original man of steel."
 
 OMS_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Conceived by Dmitry Karbyshev, an old Red general who went through years of pain and hatred by the hands of Nazi invaders, the Black League of Omsk was originally a secret military society within the Red Army ranks that sought to overturn the incompetent Communist leadership and commit the whole Russian people to the total destruction of the loathed Germans, whatever the cost.\n\nFollowing the failed coup against the Soviet government in Tyumen and the retreat to Omsk, the Black League has become entrenched in its extremist vision and seeks nothing but to bring the harsh vengeance upon all enemies of Russia and ensure that the Motherland will never be threatened again."
 
 SVR_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky and his 3rd Army defended the Soviet Union from the fascist invader until there was no longer a union to defend. Bloodied but not defeated, Rokossovsky withdrew eastward, where he found himself part of the West Siberian People's Republic. However, seeing the corruption, incompetence, and callousness of the Republic's leadership, Rokossovsky quickly became disillusioned, and when the opportunity arose, he broke away and declared a rival military government in Sverdlovsk, seizing much of the Republic's northern territories along with it.\n\nNow, Sverdlovsk stands alone against the approaching storm, the bearer of the shining light of liberty in a land of oppression and death. Rokossovsky, as old as he is, remains steadfast in his desire to reunite the Motherland with the military at the helm, serving the worker and peasant above the bureaucrat, aristocrat, or apparatchik."
 
 #Central Siberia
 TOM_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Even as the USSR burned around them, a collection of idealist Scholars, Artists, Poets, Scientists, and Authors came together in a noble attempt to rise from the ashes. This experiment quickly spread through Central Siberia, and, over time, came to be what is now known as the Central Siberian Republic. Using an unorthodox rotating constitution, rewritten after each election by the ruling party, the Republic was seen by many as a bastion of democratic thought and a revival of the democratic ideals of 1917.\n\nIn the end, ironically, it was the Bolsheviks once more that brought the Founders' dreams of democracy crashing down. Facing invasion from the east, several of the CSR's constituent cities revolted, and now the former bastion of liberty in Russia is ruled by despotic juntas, rampaging anarchists, and repressive bolsheviks. But not all hope is lost - the CSR's government, located in the city of Tomsk under a provisional government led by Boris Pasternak, has survived, and as the year 1962 dawns, the President prepares to restore full democracy to the Republic.\n\nCome then, Maestro, choose your instrument, and let the Symphony that is the Russian People play."
 
 KEM_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The story of the Principality of Kemerovo is the story of one man. Nikolay Krylov served as the Chief of Staff of the 62nd Army during the Great Patriotic War, leading it through some of the largest battles on the eastern front. No matter what Nikolay tried, every major engagement his army took part in ended in disaster. By the time the Union collapsed, the 62nd army had already fallen apart. Krylov and his clique of officers fled east, eventually finding themselves in the newly founded Central Siberian Republic. There he was charged with defeating the Siberian Black Army, who dealt him yet another humiliation on the battlefield. The last straw was when one of his closest lieutenants betrayed him and seized the city of Krasnoyarsk. Unable to cope, Krylov's psyche shattered.\n\nWhen his subordinates next saw their general, he was a changed man. He announced that he had experienced a revelation. He was the heir of Rurik, first Tsar of the Rus, and it was his destiny to reunite Russia. The newly crowned Rurik II quickly drew significant attention as men flocked to his banner, drawn by promises of loot and his unusual ideology. Rurik II is not like the monarchs of old. He has promised to be a Tsar of the Soviets, defending the proletarian revolution as the king of the workers and peasants. He has denounced Christianity and condemned the Romanov dynasty as traitors to the Russian people. No one knows what a Russia reunited by Rurik would look like, least of all himself, but as the Tsar prepares for war the world may soon find out."
 
 SBA_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Siberian Black Army rose in the bleak days of the Siberian War. As the Central Siberian Republic's authority withered and decayed, the Black Army was created by men like Pyotr Siuda and Ivan Stepanov, formed from Soviet defectors, simple peasants and rogue army officers. The newly formed army managed to repeal the Republic and take the area surrounding the city of Kansk. Forming a 'state' based around the principles of militarized anarchism. Inspired by men such as Nestor Makhno, the Siberian Black Army is a society dedicated to freedom and self defense, the army itself asserting little authority beyond what is needed for self defense and membership is a choice, the people are largely free to do as they please. Even still the Black Army's influence grows more with each passing season and many worry it may soon dominate the communes, creating a military dictatorship in all but name."
 
 NOV_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Centered in and around the largest city in Siberia, the Federation of Novosibirsk and Altay arose out of the fracturing of the Central Siberian Republic. Under the leadership of the so-called 'Siberian Falcon,' the strongman Alexander Pokryshkin, it forms one of the largest and most powerful splinter states in the region.\n\nOne of the primary beneficiaries of Bukharin's Siberian Plan, Novosibirsk itself possesses both an enormous population and an equally impressive industrial base, matched in capacity only by the prodigious agricultural lands of Altay. These dual advantages situate the state well, providing a solid economic base from which to grow.\n\nNot all is well, however. The young Federation faces threatening neighbors, socialist labor agitation, and many decisions regarding the growing influence of elitist groupings within the government - influence strongly opposed by the unofficial 'second man' within the Federation, Vasily Shukshin, the Mayor of Barnaul.\n\nThough none can say for certain whether the Federation will weather the many challenges ahead, all agree that, should it correctly leverage the significant advantages granted by both position and history, it could serve as the nucleus of a powerful - and ever expanding - nation."
 
 PRC_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As units of the Red Army retreated into Tuva and Mongolia under the command of Marshal Aleksandr Vasilevsky as the Soviet Union collapsed around them, the People's Revolutionary Council was formed jointly by the Red Army remnants and the Mongolian People's Republic out of desperation in order to stave off total collapse.\n\nSince their reluctant exile, however, the PRC has been preoccupied with domestic tensions and lack of organization, staying isolated and uninvolved as a result even during the catastrophic Siberian War, the hope the Russians held of returning home faded more and more as the years passed without any end in sight.\n\nNow, the PRC finds itself at a critical point in its existence: with the Red Army no longer able or willing to remain where they are, the time is fast approaching for them to at last charge forth once more, and take back the homeland from those who have brought it to near ruin."

 #The Far East
 AMR_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As the Soviet Union rose to power thousands upon thousands of Russians fled to wherever they could. For many in the east that was the city of Harbin in Manchuria. Bitter over their defeat in the civil war and looking for any chance at redemption or revenge, these exiles turned to the new fascist movement that was just getting off its feet in Europe. Many of the Russians in Harbin embraced Fascism as the new rival to Communism, none more than Konstantin Rodzaevsky. The young man was a fiery orator and an open supporter of Hitler's ideology of National Socialism, and he quickly ascended the ranks to become the leader of the Russian Fascist party in Harbin.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed the exiles, seeing an opportunity to retake their homeland, were quick to strike. With support from Japan, Rodzaevsky led an invasion of the Russian far east, declaring his intent to reunite the nation and create a new era of Russian national socialism. All seemed to be going well, but Rodzaevsky was betrayed by two competing cliques. The white army officers had always hesitated to embrace fascism, and when they saw the opportunity to break away they took it, pledging their allegiance to a false Tsar in Chita. In Magadan, Mikhail Matkovsky, long a challenger to Rodzaevsky's control of the RFP, declared Rodzaevsky was nothing more than a puppet of the genocidal nazis, and a traitor to the Russian nation. Now Rodzaevsky is left ruling a rump state, biding his time until he can retake what is rightfully his and teach the traitors a lesson they won't forget."
 
 BRY_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Yagoda and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in Irkutsk seem to have learned nothing from the fall of Bukharin's Union. They insist they are the true heirs to Lenin's revolution while the NKVD snuffs out all intra-party criticism. Worse yet, they stifle the local Buryat people's autonomy under a Russo-centric hegemony. After years of Yagoda's tyranny, the various dissidents within his fiefdom have risen up to overthrow him and his Presidium.\n\nThey have rallied around the charismatic young idealist Valery Sablin, a passionate Leninist who has called for true freedom and equality for all the peoples of Russia. Everyone from Bukharinites distressed by growing NKVD control, Buryats who desire autonomy, junior officers and women who seek equality have joined his mutiny. But when Sablin wins - if he wins - he will have to come face to face with pragmatic challenges of governing a state. Will Sablin's Union live up to Lenin's ideals? Or will it backslide into Bukharinist dictatorial pragmatism?"

 IRK_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "The Bukharin regime fractured and collapsed when it faced the Nazi onslaught. When Bukharin himself disappeared amidst the chaos, NKVD Director Genrikh Yagoda mobilized his surviving NKVD divisions to evacuate the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet as Eastward as he could. From there, the remains of the Bukharin government attempted to retain control over the Far East, but their grip slowly began to crumble as warlords and bandits rose up to take the land for themselves. Yagoda quickly lost confidence in the Party leadership; he and his NKVD began to take over various State functions, much to the chagrin of the Presidium.\n\nThe legitimate heirs to the Soviet Union are now in a precarious position. The balance of power in the Union is teetering between Yagoda loyalists in the State and the apparatchiks of the Party bureaucracy. As if that isn't enough, a former Soviet commander, Valery Sablin, has risen up against the Irkutsk government across Lake Baikal. Yagoda will have to quash this uprising swiftly if he hopes to one day reclaim the Union."
 
 MAG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Since the birth of the Russian Fascist Party Mikhail Matkovsky competed with Konstantin Rodzaevsky for control. Rodzaevsky was aggressive and idealistic, and openly supported Hitler's Nazism, while Matkovsky was more subtle and diplomatic, and saw the racial hatred the Nazis held for Russians plainly. The two men often butted heads but worked together for the dream of a Russia free of Bolshevism. When the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union that dream suddenly became a reality, as the RFP organized an invasion of the Russian Far East. However, Rodzaevsky's refusal to denounce National Socialism even as the Nazis carried out a genocide against the Russian people was the breaking point for Matkovsky. He knew that Germany would never tolerate a strong Russia, even a fascist one, and Rodzaevsky was only leading the nation towards suicide.\n\nMatkovsky and his supporters took control over the port of Magadan and declared that Rodzaevsky was a traitor to the motherland, and only Matkovsky would be able to reunite Russia under true fascism. Matkovsky's clique has now spent years preparing to strike south and finish Rodzaevsky once and for all. Resources in Magadan are scarce, forcing Matkovsky to turn to unusual sources of help. Mercenaries from all over the world have come to Magadan seeking fame and fortune, but the greatest source of support lies across the Pacific: the United States. Persuading the Americans will be no easy task, but if anyone can do it, it is Matkovsky."

 CHT_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "For many of the Russian exiles in Harbin, the rise of the Russian Fascist Party was a godsend. For the officers of the White Army in the city it was a nuisance. They had spent years fighting to restore the Romanov dynasty to their rightful throne, only to see the exile community abandon the monarchy for this distasteful new ideology. The old generals, led by Ataman Semyonov, reluctantly agreed to work with Rodzaevsky and the RFP more out of mutual hatred for the Bolsheviks than anything else. When the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union and it became clear Hitler was not waging war against communism, but against the Russian people, the generals were appalled by Rodzaevsky's refusal to denounce Nazism. It was decided that the partnership could not last, but the generals would wait to split until the time was right.\n\nThat time came shortly after Rodzaevsky launched his invasion of the Russian Far East. The White officers invited Prince Michael Romanov to a dinner party in Harbin. Once there they involved him in all of their schemes, declaring that they would crown him as the new Tsar and retake his empire. Both Prince Michael's reluctance to join their cause and ineligibility for the throne failed to dissuade them. Soon Semyonov's clique had seized the city of Chita, denounced the RFP and declared their loyalty to the newly crowned Tsar. Free of Rodzaevsky's control and back on Russian soil, the officers are now preparing to destroy the fascist remnants and reunite Russia in the name of Tsar Mikhail II, whether he wants it or not."
