 #Ministers
 POLITICS_JAIME_MILANS_BOSCH_DESC:0 "Born as the son of a military noble family, Jaime Milans Del Bosch was set on an early trajectory in his life. Joining the Toledo Infantry Academy in 1934 and fighting as a cadet in the Spanish Civil War he was influenced by militarist and fascist ideology. He would go on to gain an officer's commission in the Spanish Foreign Legion and serve fanatically in the Blue Division to fight against the Soviet Union under German command. After the war he did not understand the distancing Spain undertook from Germany by joining in a Union with Portugal and forming the Triumvirate with the other Mediterranean powers. He quickly began to despise the political situation in Iberia and berated anyone whom he could trust that the current regime should go in favour of a more German aligned fascist Spain. Yet his lowly officer position left his concerns unnoticed to a large extent. With the Iberian situation deteriorating and his qualms being ignored he began to radicalise further.\n\nThe Basque rising however provided opportunity. Seizing the initiative, he led a successful coup in Valladolid with fellow junior officers that quickly spread through northern Spain by means of false information and propaganda. His new movement seeks to restore all Spanish lands under a hardcore Falangist government."
