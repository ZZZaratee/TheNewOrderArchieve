 ### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_PYOTR_GAVRILOV_DESC: "Pyotr Mikhailovich Gavrilov serves the Soviet Union, as he always has. A member of the Kryashen, or "Baptized Tatars" who followed Orthodox Christianity instead of Islam, he spent his youth laboring on farms and in factories after his father's death. It was little surprise that he was drawn to socialism, and he eagerly fought for the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. He rose to the rank of Major, and his battalion was sent to occupy the newly-incorporated Brest Oblast of the Byelorussian SSR. This put him in the unfortunate location of facing the brunt of the Wehrmacht during Operation Barbarossa. Gavrilov led the defense of Brest Fortress in one of the Great Patriotic War's first battles, holding out for over a month against the Germans. However, he was eventually seriously wounded and fell into enemy captivity. As the war drew to its end, Gavrilov was transferred to the Mauthausen camp, presumably to be "liquidated" with other Soviet officers who refused to collaborate. But he helped organize a breakout, fleeing into the Alps with over a dozen of his comrades, most notably General Dmitry Karbyshev.\n\nWhen the escaped POWs returned to their war-torn homeland, they went their separate ways, trying to find the closest thing to home. Some never made it back, while others descended into petty bandrity and warlordism. Others still succumbed to madness and delusions of grandeur. But not Gavrilov - he refused to let the revolution die. He returned to his native Kazan, reestablishing order and trying to keep the flame of socialism burning. When the West Russian Revolutionary Front coalesced, Gavrilov gladly joined the fight. The offensive ground to a halt, the alliance frayed, and the front disintegrated, but Gavrilov stayed loyal, even refusing to evacuate his hometown as his comrades were driven further and further north. Now he remains as the sole southern outpost of the revolution, waiting for the opportunity to reunite with the Front and help restore the Soviet Union."

 ### Ideas ###
 KZA_red_tatars: "Red Tatars"
 KZA_red_tatars_desc: "The Grand Proletarian Revolution has finally brought the Tatars the autonomy they so desired; but counter-revolutionary elements have shattered our beloved Union, and divided our people. But the Tatars have nothing to fear; for General Gavrilov will reunite the Tatars and, once the Union properly rises from the ashes the Germans left, it will undo the mistakes of the past years and lead the Tatars towards a bright future."
