This event naturally never came to fruition, but the Werwulf plans may yet be useful. Training Hüttig's soldiers in these tactics will provide a valuable edge."

 GER_Bormann_SAF_festung_johannesburg_desc:0 "Johannesburg has been a bastion of Aryan settlement on the Dark Continent for nearly two hundred years.

Our Afrikaner allies must not be allowed to falter in the defense of their homeland.

 GRO_REICHSSTAAT_african_cabal_desc:0 "Hans Hüttig has occupied the other African Reichskommissariats, declaring the Grossafrikaner Reichsstaat. Fighting against him is a small clique of officers and administrators who call themselves the "African Cabal," loyal to Germania. While they are too weak to act independently, with our help they'll be able to resist Hüttig's mad reign. We must also protect the Cabal from the decay it will undergo once Hüttig notices its prevalence.\n\nAlternatively... the cabal situation could be manipulated to our political advantage back in the heimat, at the cost of its chances of overthrowing Hüttig.\n\nCabal Strength: (§G[?GRO.GRO_REICHSSTAAT_cabal_power|%1]§!)\nDecay: (§S[?GRO.GRO_REICHSSTAAT_cabal_decay|%1]§!)\n\n§YThe cabal's strength will dictate its odds of succeeding upon the collapse of the Reichsstaat...§!"
 GER_cabal_supply_weapons:0 "Arm Friendly Rebel Forces"
 GER_cabal_supply_weapons_desc:0 "There is irony to be found in the fact that we are funding partisans to undermine our own former colony. Still, we can't deny that we need to resort to such methods to weaken Hüttig's stranglehold over Africa: by arming loyal Germans who still fight for the remnants of Zentralafrika and Südwestafrika, we'll force the madman to overstretch his already-meagre forces, reducing his control over the abomination he calls "state" and strengthening our allies"
 GER_cabal_administrative_aid:0 "Bolster Anti-Hüttig Factions"
 GER_cabal_administrative_aid_desc:0 "The Cabal fights every single day, not only to undermine Hüttig's hold over the continent, but also to keep their heads on their neck. This is far more than a metaphor, as Hüttig is known for his tendency to resort to mass executions for the slightest hint of treason: by sending our secret services to help them, we can make sure that Hüttig is kept too busy with other problems to bother with discovering our friends."
 GER_cabal_cover_em:0 "Cover Up Cabal Efforts"
 GER_cabal_cover_em_desc:0 "As the last loyal men in Quelimane work to undermine the madman Hüttig, we must ensure that they are not discovered. By burning certain paper trails and constructing falsified ones in their place, we can avert suspicion of our agents in Africa, at least for now."
 GER_cabal_fund_them:0 "Fund the Cabal"
 GER_cabal_fund_them_desc:0 "The Cabal is an expensive endeavor, requiring a wide web of agents and bribes to expand their power base and remain hidden from Hüttig's paranoid eye. By granting our allies secret funds, we can strengthen their connections and ensure they can keep being useful to the Reich."
 GER_cabal_siphon_funds:0 "Siphon Funds from the Reichsstaat"
 GER_cabal_siphon_funds_desc:0 "Our friends in the Cabal can be very much useful to us. By exploiting their connections, we can steal money and siphon funds from the coffers of our rogue colony: while highly beneficial for our budget, this will surely put several members of the clique at risk of being discovered, and we all know what happens when Hüttig catches someone with their hands on his money..."
 GER_cabal_implicate_political_enemies:0 "Implicate Our Political Enemies"
 GER_cabal_implicate_political_enemies_desc:0 "While the Cabal's first and foremost task is protecting our interests in Africa, they have... other uses which may prove highly beneficial to us. For instance, what would happen if someone who opposes our reforms was found in possession of documents proving deep and extremely compromising connections to none other than Hans Hüttig, a traitor Reichskommissar who illegally occupies our colonies in Africa and has thrown his lots with the likes of Himmler.."
 GER_cabal_hide_funding:0 "Obfuscate Funding Sources"
 GER_cabal_hide_funding_desc:0 "Hüttig and his minions are getting suspicious as of late, due to our activities or their own raging paranoia. It would be wise to scale down our efforts for a while, and use our secret services to cover any leftover trace of our secret funding. Between us, CIA, the Kenpeitai and the SIM, literally everyone in the world has a reason to undermine the Reichsstaat, something that makes it very easy to lay the blame on everyone but us..."
 GER_cabal_provide_training:0 "Provide Training"
 GER_cabal_provide_training_desc:0 "The forces of the Cabal are few and weak compared to the SS serving Hüttig. Every man counts, and we need to ensure that they'll be ready when the madman's little empire inevitably collapses. Through our secret services, we'll infiltrate special teams charged with providing training in both asymmetric warfare and counterintelligence, increasing their ability to protect themselves from Hüttig's paranoia, and to resist when everything crumbles around them."
