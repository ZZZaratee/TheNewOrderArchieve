 #TNO_OPENING_DESC:0 "Welcome to The New Order: Old World Blues! Old World Blues is a demo for The New Order: Last Days of Europe and much smaller in scope than the released mod will be. In this demo, you will be able to fully enjoy four nations: The noble Ural League, the proud communes of Orenburg, the foul bandits of the Dirlewanger Brigade, and the ever-plotting Lysenko of Magnitogorsk.\n\nYou will find these nations fully playable for a bit over five years, primarily for the duration that they are all killing one another. The New Order does not play like many other mods, and is as a narrative experience as much as it is a gameplay one, though you will find the Southern Urals to be fairly gameplay driven regardless.\n\nAll other nations in the mod have had their content removed for the purposes of this demo. However, you will notice the world still changing as the demo progress, giving you hints at what else is to come!\n\nIf you are interested in the mod and like what you see here, please like and favorite the mod, and check us out on social media! You can find links to our Discord, Reddit, and several other sites on the main menu, as well from our Steam page.\n\nThe New Order has been created due to the tireless efforts of numerous developers, contributors, artists, writers, moderators, and a plucky composer. I started this mod over five years ago now, originally for Victoria 2, and it was a very different mod then. Now, for almost two years, me and my team have tirelessly been turning The New Order from a little pet project into something we can all truly be proud of. Over two hundred people have at some point contributed to our project, not counting the numerous donations of work and time given to us by our friends in the HOI4 Modding Coop and beyond, an organization I helped found and am proud to stand by to this day.\n\nWe have faced numerous challenges, but have been blessed with a community that has stood with us through it all. For their patience, dedication, and love, we wanted to reward them and give something back. To our beautiful community, this is for you. Thank you all so much. We are humbled every day just thinking of the great expectations and the amazing support you have given us.\n\nThank you everyone, and please enjoy the demo! There is so much more to come from us, and we hope you will be there along the ride!\n\n~ThePinkPanzer, Lead Developer.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 COUNTRY_INFO_VYATKA: "§G==THE PRINCIPALITY OF VYATKA==§!\n\nThe near-total collapse of Soviet authority in the wake of the West Russian War has, over the years, resulted in all manner of ambitious warlords rising through the ashes and staking their claim to Russia. One such group is a ghost from Russia's turbulent past: the remnants of the Romanov dynasty led by §WVladimir III§! and his allies.\n\nDuring the West Russian War, the hard-pressed German forces allowed a division of European émigrés loyal to the exiled §WVladimir Kirillovich§! to join the fight against the resurgent §RRed Army§!, where they would play a key role in a desperate Wehrmacht offensive. Although the Germans were eventually forced to withdraw, the monarchists pushed on regardless, and were able to establish a permanent foothold in §WVyatka§!. Now §WVladimir III§! and the émigré cliques oversee the strongest bastion of monarchism in Russia. That being said, §WVyatka§! is beginning to face internal divisions. The émigré cliques bicker amongst themselves and compete for political dominance, while the antiquated bureaucracy of the §WPrincipality§! continues to cause problems as time marches on. The Okhrana, the §WPrincipality's§! secret police led by Boris Smyslovsky, has so far been successful in ensuring stability for the regime, but the question of how much power they should wield remains. These issues will need to be addressed before any serious plans for reclamation can begin.\n\nInternally, the §WPrincipality§! is divided between three émigré cliques of equal import. Firstly are the Constitutional Democrats, led by the émigré §WRoman Gul§!, who represent the liberals. They wish to create a functioning constitutional monarchy, complete with guaranteed rights for minorities. Secondly, the Solidarists led by §WAleksandr Solzhenitsyn§! are staunch nationalists with some authoritarian tendencies. That being said, they still wish for some degree of reform from the antiquated systems of yesteryear. Finally, there is §WVasily Shulgin's§! faction, the All-Russian National Union. §WShulgin§! is a politician of the old school, with a history of service dating back to the days of Tsar Nicholas II. Like the liberals, he favors constitutionalism as well, but does not wish to disrupt the traditions of the old Empire.\n\nExternally, §WVyatka§! is surrounded by potential threats. To the southeast, the madmen of the §RAryan Brotherhood§! serve as the most pressing threat. In the north, the unstable §RRepublic of Komi§! is unpredictable and should be carefully monitored, while the §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§! stirs. If §WVyatka§! is to unite Russia, conflict with them is inevitable. Meanwhile, raids from the §RTatar§! and §RBashkir§! warlords to the west and south are common but are unlikely to escalate into a full-blown conflict for now. Further to the southwest, however, is §RAndrey Vlasov§! and the so-called §RRussian Liberation Army§! based in §RSamara§!. Unlike the §RTatars§!, they harbor ambitions of expansion and may cause problems in the future if left unchecked. To the east lies the warlord of §GGayny§!. Relations with §GGayny§! have mostly been cordial, and it may be possible to sway them to the cause.\n\nThe §WPrincipality of Vyatka§! now stands poised to undertake the arduous task of uniting Russia once and for all. Will Russia find itself ruled by a Tsar once more? Only time will tell...\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n- Decide between constitutionalism or the old government.\n\n- Prepare the §WPrincipality's§! armies for conflict with rival warlords.\n\n- Unify the §WRussian Empire§! once more."

 COUNTRY_INFO_SAMARA: "§G==THE COMMITTEE FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA==§!\n\nIn the bloodiest days of the West Russian War, when it seemed like the Reich's hold on Russia was on the verge of slipping forever, the German high command turned to desperate means to stave off the collapse of their front line. Drawn from a range of auxiliary colonial militias of Russian conscripts that were meant to police German-held Russia, the §WRussian Liberation Army§! or §WROA§! was created. In propaganda, the §WROA§! was depicted as a proud Russian army, fighting the §Rbolshevik§! menace of the §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§!. In desperation, the Germans even allowed the creation of the §WCommittee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia§!, or §WKONR§!, as the embryo of a free Russian Republic that would rule over areas liberated by the German counter offensives.\n\nReality was much less flattering to the §WROA§!. Its leader §WAndrey Vlasov§!, a former Red Army general, was nothing more than a puppet of the Wehrmacht's high command. His officers were a a disjointed bunch. Many were also captured Red Army officers, preferring to join the §WROA§! than die in a German POW camp. Others were fascist émigrés, joining the §WROA§! on a great crusade to defeat §RBolshevism§!. The common soldiers were desperate cannon fodder, drafted at gunpoint by the Germans and sent to reinforce the most desperate sectors of the front. Far from being welcomed as liberators, Russian people caught in the conflict area welcomed §WROA§! soldiers with rock and insults.\n\nDespite all this, the §WROA§! pushed on. The soldiers fought with the energy of desperation, and managed to help turn the tide in the sector around §WSamara§!. Soon the §WROA§! found itself beyond the German lines, freed from their former taskmasters. With the war winding down and the §RWRRF§! in retreat, the Germans wrote off their cannon fodder as mutinous Slav Untermensch. The new headquarters of the §WROA§! in Samara were not spared any of the terror bombing campaigns that followed.\n\nSince then the §WROA§! has huddled in Samara, having traded one prison for another. Unable to expand their area of control by the terror bombings, and forbidden to go back home in the west, the common soldiers of the army have languished for the better part of a decade in their garrisons. The §WROA's§! officers, meanwhile, have grown weary of §WVlasov's§! indecisiveness. They argue for a more decentralized leadership, and for the abandonment of §WKONR's§! original democratic mission in favor of a continuation of the §WROA's§! junta. Using general §WSergei Bunyachenko§! as their mouthpiece, the men of the Officer's Committee scheme to take advantage of §WVlasov's§! apathy and old age. However the officers are not all united in ideology. Quite a few have formed a pro-democracy faction, and argue that §WVlasov's§! heir as chairman of §WKONR§! should be §WMiletiy Zykov§!, a former journalist that has maneuvered his way into being the chief propagandist of the §WROA's§! regime in Samara. Zykov argues for the continued struggle to liberate Russia from §RBolshevism§! as well as German oppression. In between all this, many common soldiers and lower ranking officers have grown tired of the high command's bickering and seek to follow General §WOktan's§! goal to use the §WROA§! to build a strong, fascist state... and to enrich the soldiers in the process.\n\nThe §WROA§! is at a crossroad. Loathed by all their neighbors as German collaborators, yet feared for their veteran army and iron discipline, the men of the §WROA§! await the end of the terror bombing. Some seek to redeem their honor by rebuilding Russia. Others seek vengeance on the communists and on the Germans who have ruined their life. Finally, a growing minority simply want to lash out at the uncaring world that has forced them to lose a decade holed in Samara.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n- Determine who shall win the power struggle to be the successor of §WVlasov§! as leader of the §WROA§!.\n\n- Finish what the Germans could not do and destroy the §RWRRF§! once and for all.\n\n- Show the world the perils of underestimating the so-called "traitorous dogs of the ROA.""
 
 COUNTRY_INFO_1_KOM: "§G==THE KOMI REPUBLIC==§!\n\nThe failures of §RNikolai Bukharin§!, the §RGerman§! invasion, and the defeat of the §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§! against the §RGerman Reich§! bled the people of Russia far too much, subjecting them to unimaginable horror and destitution for little gain. Rather than the worker's utopia promised by the §RSoviet government§!, the communist experiment ended in failure, as apocalyptic warfare scorched West Russia for the second time in two decades.\n\nThe former government of the §GKomi ASSR§!, a faithful band of Soviet loyalist politicians, gladly went along with §RGrand Marshal Kliment Voroshilov§!'s plans for the restoration of the §RSoviet government§!, and Komi, despite the reservations that its highly politically deviant population held, gladly slipped into the pocket of the §RFront§!, until the West Russian War, and the transition of the §RFront§!'s capital to Syktyvkar.\n\nThe War, the political failures of the §RFront§!, the final assassination of Alexei Rykov, and the bombing of the §RPresidium of the West Russian Revolutionary Front§! marked the last straw for the Komi government, however. §GNikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky§!, the newly appointed head of the §GKomi ASSR§!, took executive action to declare independence from the §RFront§!, being aided in his operation by a slew of former §RWRRF§! politicians, including §xMikhail Andreyevich Suslov§!, foreign minister of the Front, and §SAndrey Alexandrovich Zhdanov§!, a prominent official of the ComIntern.\n\nWith the secession of the §GKomi ASSR§! from the §RFront§! under a newly declared §GRepublic§!, and the loss of yet another capital, the political cohesion of the §RFront§! dissolved, and more and more separatists ate away at the §RWRRF§!'s armies before operations could be launched to put down the rebellions and warlords.\n\nWith the democratic nature of the §GKomi Republic§! becoming well-known throughout West Russia, and the developed city of Syktyvkar becoming swollen with refugees from other, less accommodating warlord states, a climate of political radicalism began to fester within the §GRepublic§!, fed by §GVoznesensky§!'s collaboration with §SZhdanov§!'s communists, and the underground influence of §Rextremist politicians§! who had been set free from the many former GULAGs in the region. Political violence, grand scheming, and paramilitary activity became commonplace, with the corruption within the §GRepublic§!'s armed forces doing nothing to help matters, despite the efforts of talented officers such as §GPetro Grigorenko§! and §GIvan Korolkov§!.\n\n§YThe State of the Komi Republic:§!\nThe state of the §GRepublic§! in 1962 is hardly one conducive to functional democracy, or civilized life. Crime is at a recent high, with constant paramilitary street battles shattering the silence on the streets of Syktyvkar. The plots of shadowy ideologues are constantly pit against each other, in the form of assassinations, thefts, fraud, assault, extortion, and conspiracy against the Republic. While power is brokered within the §GNational Assembly§!, and the §G"Democratic Coalition"§! of relatively centrist parties attempts to keep order and sane governance, §xMikhail Suslov§!'s §xCommunist Party of Komi§! on the far left and §OLev Gumilyov§!'s §OPassionariyy Organization§! on the far right constantly attempt to bring down the government in the shadows, while maintaining a respectable public opinion.\n\n§YThe Players of the Game:§!\nThe §GKomi Republic§!'s politicians are infamous for a particular nature that seems to run through the §GRepublic§! as a whole - a pseudo-addiction to scheming, backstabbing, and power games. Regardless of whether they personally tolerate such underhanded tactics, the environment of the §GRepublic§! demands such tendencies, and so, the politicians which survive this unimaginably stressful environment tend to be forged into metaphorical diamonds - master schemers and maneuverers who can manipulate entire parties beneath their thumb.\n\n§BThe Centre:§!\nDespite the wide variety of democratic parties and the issues which cleave movements apart in Komi, the saving grace of the §GRepublic§! is that democracy, too, is a political question and hot-button topic. The intensity of the efforts to tear down democracy has forged the otherwise disparate centrist parties into a ramshackle coalition to preserve the electoral system at all costs, and fight radicalism. The ruling §PPeople's Democratic Socialist Party (DSNP)§!, §MUnion of Young Reformers (SMR)§!, and §gSovereign Democratic Party (PSD)§! have all become tempered allies in the environment of the §GRepublic§!.\n\n§PNikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky:§!\nThe §GPresident of the Republic§! and leader of the §PPeople's Democratic Socialist Party§! since its founding, §PNikolai Voznesensky§! is a rather controversial man. Despite his initial electoral popularity, his constant scandals, often revolving around his abrasiveness, racist comments, or allegations of corruption, have eroded his popularity and cast many members of his party into an unfavorable public light. His friendship with the communist leader §SAndrei Zhdanov§! has come under scrutiny in recent months, and it only remains to be seen whether the 1963 election shall be the end of §PVozesensky§!'s political career, or merely the start of his next term."
 
 COUNTRY_INFO_2_KOM: "§MAlexei Nikolayevich Kosygin:§!\nA prominent elected Deputy, and leader of the §MUnion of Young Reformers§!, §MAlexei Kosygin§! is famed as a rather quiet and respectful politician, who serves as the chief "peacemaker" within the center. However, his disillusionment with the current composition of the §GCoalition§! is growing with each and every new scandal §PVoznesensky§! finds himself in, and he constantly finds himself looking at his own potential bid for power. Along with his close friend, §gSvetlana Stalina§!, §MKosygin§! forms the "hardline" wing of the centrist coalition - the wing that will never allow for capitulation to the radicals.\n\n§gSvetlana Iosifovna Stalina:§!\nA former §PDSNP§! member who split to form the §gSovereign Democratic Party§! following yet another infamous scandal, §gSvetlana Stalina§! is a rather young and idealistic firebrand who has overcome her reputation as a splitter, and cut out a position as a force in her own right. §gStalina§! forms the trustworthy right flank of the coalition, with a platform that combines a patriotic, security-centered policy with a strong focus on welfare and public works. Her constant praise of institutional power and stability, as well as her desire to stabilize the foundation of the §GRepublic§! by any means necessary, has led to constant accusations of authoritarianism, but her coalition partners tend to dismiss these claims. After all, §gStalina§! is utterly uncompromising - in her eyes, a strong, democratic §GRussian Free Republic§! is worth the cost - no matter how painful the means are to get there.\n\n§xThe Left:§!\nThe §xCommunist Party of Komi§! is notable in that it is the most united political "wing" in the Republic. The infamous §xMikhail Suslov§! has forged an ironclad political machine out of the far left, leading successful operation after operation to stage scandals, shatter the people's confidence in the government, and establish an environment of constant pressure on the §GRepublic§!'s security forces. However, despite its unity, not all is well within the §xCommunist Party§!. The cracks between its leaders are invisible in public, but all too apparent behind closed doors. In the eyes of Party insiders, a conflict between §xMikhail Suslov§! and §rIvan Serov§!'s orthodox faction and §SAndrei Zhdanov§! and §lSvetlana Bukharina§!'s reformist faction is inevitable - all that remains to be seen is how destructive it shall be to the §xParty§!'s very foundations.\n\n§xMikhail Andreyevich Suslov:§!\nThe stories that one would hear of Komi's infamous "shadow master", §xMikhail Suslov§!, are awe-inspiring, and wide in scope. According to various citizens of the §GRepublic§!, §xSuslov§! is personally behind nearly every aspect of the chaos in Komi, personally orchestrating street battles, robberies, and blackmailing rings while he plays the violin in his townhouse. Not every story is true, of course, but §xSuslov§!'s reputation speaks for itself.\n\nA famed leader within the WRRF with such a fearful political reputation that §RMikhail Tukhachevsky§! condemned him for couping the government without any evidence, §xSuslov§! has maintained his talents throughout the Russian wasteland, honing them more and more as his career advances. §xSuslov§! is a brilliant man who views the §GRepublic§! as his chessboard - a complex machine made up of interlocking mechanisms of class conflict and civil strife. With every move of his paramilitaries and "unaffiliated" Deputies in the §GNational Assembly§!, he comes closer and closer to his goal - the end of the §GRepublic§!, and the restoration of the §RUSSR§!, with himself as the grey cardinal behind it all.\n\n§SAndrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov:§!\n§SAndrei Zhdanov§! is a walking contradiction. He is the leader of the §xCommunist Party§!'s §GNational Assembly§! delegation, and one of the highest figures in the Party - yet his libertarianism and populism seems to fly in the face of what §xSuslov§! is widely considered to want. §SZhdanov§! is a visionary in every way, a fierce, charismatic firebrand - yet he tends to align with §PVoznesensky§!'s government constantly, seemingly missing opportunities to perpetuate the §RRevolution§! that the §xCommunist Party§! so desires. The mystery behind §SZhdanov§!'s motivations and operations raise many questions, but none can doubt his character. According to many centrists across the aisle, if one Communist were to take power, it would have to be §SZhdanov§!. After all... where else could one find such charming, moderate, populist spirit?\n\n§lSvetlana Nikolaevna Bukharina:§!\nThe emergence of the daughter of the doomed §RNikolai Bukharin§! within the §GRepublic§! was hardly expected, but it was hailed by many communists as a sign that their movement was destined for greatness comparable to the strength of the old §RVKP(b)§!. §lSvetlana Bukharina§! rapidly rose into the ranks of the §xCommunist Party§!, being elected by unheard-of margins, bringing her unstoppable energy and ambition with her. Despite her comparative youth compared to many figures within the government, and her questionable adherence to the letter of the line that §xSuslov§! promotes within the §xParty§!, §lBukharina§! is most certainly one of the foremost communists within the §GRepublic§! - and the brightest, most radiant rising star among their number."
 
 COUNTRY_INFO_3_KOM: "§YThe Right:§!\nThe §OPassionariyy Organization§! is a singularly bizarre organization in Komi, a combination of a social club, a secret society, and an apparatus for political coalition-building. Under the wide-spanning umbrella of the §OPassionariyy§! are Eurasianists, "compassionate conservatives", monarchists, and other, smaller movements, all united solely by the desire for a new, right-wing path for the §GRepublic§!. The §OPassionariyy§! are easily the most wide-ranging coalition in Komi, stretching to every possible corner of right-wing thought, and, as of such, paradoxically both prone to infighting, and extremely effective at operating within the §GRepublic§!. Within the §OPassionariyy§!, there is someone for everyone, or so it is said - the media outlets controlled by the organization appeal to the people, rallies are held, and the §Gcenter coalition§! is forced to look closer and closer towards §OPassionariyy§!-affiliated politicians each day.\n\n§OLev Nikolayevich Gumilyov:§!\nThere is only one man in the §GRepublic§! with the cunning and political acumen to unite so many disparate rightist groups under one banner, and his name is §OLev Gumilyov§!. An eccentric philosopher and a well-spoken ideologue, §OGumilyov§! is the ideological heart of the §OPassionariyy Organization§!... and the brain, as well. His theories of a Eurasian civilizational empire are ones that most of the Komi right can at least pretend to get behind, and his ideals of rapid expansionism, the restoration of national strength, and a culture of patriotism appeal to the teeming multitudes that attend his rallies. Despite his seemingly unthinkable level of extremism, §OGumilyov§! is the center of the §OPassionariyy§! in spirit, and he will not halt his shadowy operations until his theories may be tested and realized on the grandest scale imaginable.\n\n§YIgor Rostislavovich Shafarevich:§!\nEvery movement needs a face, and §YIgor Shafarevich§! is a respectable face indeed. A well-respected academic in the §GRepublic§!, §YShafarevich§! heads the moderate "moralist" wing of the §OPassionariyy§! - the wing most keyed to gathering public support, and the support of the centrists within the §GNational Assembly§!. §YShafarevich§! is one of the most famous voices of the §OPassionariyy§!, and his calls for a "National Democracy" based off of "compassionate conservative" principles are heard around the §GRepublic§!, on widespread venues such as Radio Free Syktyvkar, the pre-eminent broadcasting service within the §GRepublic§!. As the left grows larger and more threatening, Shafarevich's commitment to democracy and willingness to cooperate with the Centre has driven more and more politicians amongst the right-wing of the ruling coalition to look his way, seeking deliverance from the communist threat.\n\n§jSergey Vladimirovich Taboritsky:§!\nThe black horse of Komi, the enigmatic §jSergey Taboritsky§! is famous as an almost anachronistic figure. His Imperial regalia, his nostalgic calls for the restoration of the §RRussian Empire§!, and his vast hidden personal wealth may, in a different state, tear the people away from supporting him, but in Komi, it merely serves to captivate the imagination. §jTaboritsky§! is quite possibly the most populist of the §OPassionariyy§!, tirelessly campaigning for his §jOVRI§! - the §jSociety for the Restoration of the Russian Empire§!. However, among those who have spent time close to him, it has become apparent that something is very, very wrong with §jTaboritsky§! - the look in his eyes is not quite that of a man driven by sheerly mortal energy, and his mannerisms have consistently grown more bizarre...\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n- Fight through the storm of intrigue to save the §GRepublic§!... or bring it §Rcrashing down§!.\n\n- Experiment with the many ideologies and parties present within the §GRepublic§!, and bring one to victory.\n\n- Put an end to §Rwarlordism and anarchy§!, uniting Russia under the flag of one of Komi's many contenders."

 COUNTRY_INFO_ONEGA: "§G==THE ANTI-COMMUNIST VOLUNTEER GUARD==§!\n\nThe Third Reich had assured the people of the §GFinnish Republic§! that the §RSoviet Union§! would never again threaten Finland, nor its territorial gains in §WKarelia§!.\n\nThe West Russian War proved this to be a damned lie. The §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§! remnants of the Red Army in Western Russia nearly managed to derail Germany's new order in Europe. Once the dust had settled, the §GFinnish Republic§! found its eastern border occupied by the remnants of the §RWRRF§!. Looking only to themselves for safety, Finland turned to... unorthodox solutions. §WRussians§! living in Karelia and around §WLake Onega§! were captured by §GFinland's§! new military government. The men were separated from their family, and forcibly drafted into the new §GAnti-Communist Volunteer Guard§!. Led by former Red Army General §WVladimir Kirpichnikov§!, this army of the damned would hold the borderland between Finland and the §RWRRF§!. Helsinki's dictats were very simple: all the Guardsmen had to do was to defend §WKarelia§! from §Rbandits§! and from the §Rcommunists§! to the east. Loyal service would let the Guardsmen see their family again.\n\nNearly a decade on, the men of the Guard cling onto this promise of seeing their family once more. Their task is a gruelling, thankless one. As they patrol the Arctic land around §WLake Onega§!, fighting bandits and communist infiltrators, the Guardsmen look east with uncertainty. The winds are changing in Western Russia, and it is likely that soon their fellow countrymen will come knocking to recapture the land stolen by §GFinland§!. Ill-equipped, the Guard continues its watch.

 COUNTRY_INFO_WRRF: "§G==THE WEST RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONARY FRONT==§!\n\nThe §RGreat Patriotic War§! against the §Rfascist invader§! cost the Soviet people everything, and then some. The Nazis employed unimaginable cruelty in a crusade against Soviet civilization itself, to the extent where no single man or woman couldn't name someone close to them who had been cruelly torn from them by the hands of the §RHitlerites§!.\n\nIn the muddled anarchy after the total collapse of central government authority, the remnants of the §GRed Army§! in the west reorganized in the city of Kuybyshev under the leadership of §GGrand Marshal Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov§!. Across the former territory of the Soviet Union, loyal §GRed Army§! units flocked to his banner, including the Sixth and Ninth armies under Marshals §GMikhail Nikolayevich Tukhachevsky§! and §GGeorgy Konstantinovich Zhukov§!, respectively. With these powerful mechanized forces, and an alliance with prominent political figures such as §RMikhail Andreyevich Suslov§!, the newly formed §WWest Russian Revolutionary Front§! was able to exert authority over all of the shattered remnants of the Union which remained west of the Urals.\n\nIn the late 1950's, with the §RReich§! paralyzed by the deadliest economic crash in history, and the §GRed Army§! only becoming more eager to avenge their defeat, §GGrand Marshal Voroshilov§! decided that the time had come to launch §ROperation Suvorov§!; the liberation of all Soviet lands currently occupied by §RGerman§! forces. Despite Lazar Kaganovich refusing to commit the forces of the West Siberian People's Republic to the operation, the §GRed Army§!'s advance was swift and brutal. Voroshilovgrad was liberated on day 28 of the operation, prompting an attempted coup by the §RSS§! under §RHeinrich Himmler§!. Spurred by the infighting within the enemy's ranks, §GRed Army§! troops reached the outskirts of Leningrad and Moscow by day 40.\n\nRiding high on this wave of success, few noticed the §Rcracks§! that had formed within the §WFront§!'s political structure over the years. The exact cause of the §Rdisintegration§! of the §WFront§! during the §RWest Russian War§! remains unknown, with theories ranging from an attempted seizure of power by §RSuslov§! to the breakdown of the critically overextended command structure. Facing threats to the security of the §Gmilitary leadership§! in the face of a §Rrenewed German offensive§! employing the collaborationist forces of the §RRussian Liberation Army§! and §RVladimir Romanov§!, the government was relocated to the city of Syktyvkar. Following the political turmoil, and the string of defeats at the hands of the enemy, the §RRepublic of Komi§! seceded from the §WFront§!, and the subsequent string of defections and secessions marked the end of the §RWest Russian War§! and the death of the §WWest Russian Revolutionary Front§!.\n\nOr so the §RGermans§! thought. The §WFront§! lives on, clinging to life amongst the permafrost tundra around the embattled city of §GArkhangelsk§!, with its generals bitterly divided after the catastrophic failure of §ROperation Suvorov§!. To the south sit the Military Districts of §WPlesetsk§! and §WUkhta§!, ostensibly loyal vassals trusted with the management of the Front's anti-aircraft defenses against the §RGerman terror bombings§!, and upkeep of the oilfields respectively. However, these domains serve a very different purpose, to keep §GTukhachevsky§! and §GZhukov§!, and all the factional politics that follow them far, far away from the leadership in Arkhangelsk.\n\nMarshals §GMikhail Nikolayevich Tukhachevsky§! and §GGeorgy Konstantinovich Zhukov§! are widely considered to be the two potential successors in the event of §GVoroshilov§!'s §Runtimely death§!;\n\n§GTukhachevsky§! is a talented, if somewhat eccentric officer who believes in the role of the §GRed Army§! as the primary driver of political change. A former noble who turned against the conformity of his class to join the Bolsheviks in the §GCivil War§!, §GTukhachevsky§! has gained support from a number of elements within the Front, who wish to avoid the mistakes made by §RBukharin§!, and return the §GUSSR§! to its former §Gmilitary glories§! and §Gbeyond§!, with every cog inside its machine turning towards one singular goal, every soldier marching towards final victory.\n\n§GZhukov§! is a talented, popular commander who received fame and admiration amongst his men from the §GCivil War§! to §ROperation Suvorov§!, leading the liberation of Voroshilovgrad together with §GMarshal Momyshuly§!. While §GZhukov§! is fiercely loyal to the communist cause, his clique has attracted the attention of some reform-minded figures such as §GAlexander Yakovlev§! and §GNikolay Ryzhkov§!, along with many of the hardliners unaffiliated with Tukhachevsky's faction such as §GSergey Akhromeyev§!.\n\nNow, in 1962, the §WFront§!'s situation is a precarious one.

There, they found an ally of circumstance in the irrelevant apparatchik §RLazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich§!, who proclaimed the West Siberian People's Republic with their support. As the terror bombing began and the Republic spiralled into disarray, the 3rd Army's leader took it upon himself to protect the Russian people from all manner of tyranny. That man was §GMarshal Konstantin Konstantinovich Rokossovsky§!, who rallied his forces and proclaimed a provisional government in the city of §GSverdlovsk§!.\n\nSverdlovsk lacks any defining ideological characteristics; instead it remains a fairly benevolent military dictatorship ruled by §GRokossovsky§! and his officer comrades. The military is a formidable force. Commanded by §GPavel Ivanovich Batov§!, it consists of the 3rd Army and a significant number of auxiliary units raised from the population of Sverdlovsk. It also employs some of the most skilled generals in all of Russia. Control of the city of Sverdlovsk provides the District with access to a sizable industrial base, which in turn has created a stable and relatively higher quality of life than most other warlords.\n\nDespite all of this, Sverdlovsk's internal situation is shaky. A great deal of the citizenry is at least sympathetic to §RTyumen§!, having only defected involuntarily when 3rd Army garrisons turned up on their doorstep.

Led by the Poet-President §WBoris Pasternak§!, the new nation set out to build itself up as the basis of a new Russian Democracy, a heir to the one killed in 1918 by Lenin and his Bolsheviks.\n\nThis dream rapidly turned to a nightmare. Landlocked and unable to trade with the rest of the world, the Central Siberian economy struggled to adjust. Separatist sentiment in Barnaul, breadbasket of the Republic, brought instability and food riots throughout the nation. Sensing weakness, §RGenrikh Yagoda's§! §RFar Eastern Soviet Socialist Republic§! launched an invasion of the §WCentral Siberian Republic§!, no doubt lured by the industrial wealth left over from Bukharin's Central Siberian Plan. The war was the spark that set off a chain reaction of disasters. Regional military leaders in §RNovosibirsk§! seceded, citing the central government's inability to win the war and end the bloodshed. In the east, §Ranarchist§! rebels seceded from the failing Republic. An attempt to recapture the area by General Krylov led to further defeats after the betrayal of colonel §RAndreev§! and the loss of §RKrasnoyarsk§!.

Gathering all the men that would follow him, Vasilevsky set out to regroup on the Mongolian steppe where the Luftwaffe could not reach them. There Vasilevsky hoped to regroup on the steppe, pushing out from the East to the West. His aim was to avoid the food scarcity and bombing that those who went north with Voroshilov suffer now. Unfortunately, the Imperial Japanese Army was advancing upon these lands already.\n\nWith their collaborators, the Japanese Imperialists would claim all of Mongolia. Would the Red Army abandon the Mongolian people to exploitation and deprivation? Could Vasilevsky rejoin with his brethren in the WRRF if he did so?

The Russians, made up entirely of Red Army veterans, wish to return to their homeland and restore the Soviet order upon the warlords. The Mongolians, who hold solidarity with the Tuvans, desire to push against the puppets of the Sphere. They sense weakness now that Mengjiang is torn apart in open rebellion and see this as the perfect opportunity to unite the nation. If Vasilevsky is to keep the Council whole he must navigate the desires of both groups.\n\nIt will be no easy task. The Russians and Mongolians are both proud peoples.

His closest advisors, §WGeorgy Shekerev§! and §WAlexaner Bolotov§!, the head of the party's paramilitary Blackshirts and the security minister respectively, have indulged his paranoia, bringing the Vozhd lists of internal party members who are dissenters and troublesome figures within the regime.\n\nThe Vozhd plans on creating a strong Russia based in national socialism, where the Vozhd is paramount and his system, derived from the Germans, is law. However, to do this, he will need to cleanse the party of the people responsible for its failures. The Vozhd's immediate internal and external threats need to be dealt with before he can focus on ending the Bolshevik remnants to the West. To the north, Mikhail Matkovsky's so-called §RFree State of Magadan§! taunts the Vozhd's every waking hour, while to the west, based in Chita, the farcical §RTransbaikal Principality§! represents the remnants of the traitorous Whites. Both will need to be dealt with and their leadership annihilated before the Vozhd and his party can focus on the true threat in the Far East: §RGenrikh Yagoda's§! §RPresidium of the Supreme Soviet§! and their anarchistic mutineers based in §RBuryatia§!. None shall stand in §GKonstantin Rodzaevsky's§! path. §WFor God, Nation, and Labor!§!\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n- Purge the §Rrot§! from the Russian Fascist Party.\n\n- End the §RSplitters§! and defeat the §RBolsheviks§!, securing the Vozhd's position of power.\n\n- Reforge a §GNational Russian State§! in the image of the Vozhd."

Fascism, a modern ideology, a rejection of decadent liberalism and unnatural socialism, seemed to §GMatkovsky§! the way forward. Russia would be made strong. Once the §RSoviet Union§! Inevitably crumbled, the true heirs of Harbin would come forth from Japanese Manchuria and begin the great crusade to liberate Russia.\n\n§RKonstantin Rodzaevsky§! brought doubt to §GMatkovsky's§! mind. The so-called Vozhd of the §WRussian Fascist Party§! was an amoral brute. His associates; jumped-up thugs, men of no caliber, the refuse of the Russian community in Harbin. When Germany invaded Russia, brutalizing its people, the RFP's leader wrote sycophantic letters of praise to the men who despoiled Russia. No, §RRodzaevsky§! could not be trusted to save Russia. And so §GMatkovsky§! began to plot. With the help of §gNikolay Petlin§!, a man known in Harbin for his ties to the Russo-American community, §GMatkovsky§! waited.\n\nThe opportunity of a lifetime came in the late fifties. §RYagoda§!'s pathetic Soviet remnants launched a futile war to conquer the §WCentral Siberian Republic§!. The strain of fighting broke down both nations, letting the White community in Harbin free to strike. The invasion broke the back of §RYagoda's§! state, liberating Chita, Amur and Magadan. In this moment of triumph for the RFP, §GMatkovsky§! enacted his plan. The port city of Magadan was seized, along with a great deal of the RFP's invasion force. §RRodzevsky's§! thugs were pushed back to §RAmur§!, deprived of the critical port of §GMagadan§!.\n\nIn §GMagadan§! the true leader of the §GRussian Fascist Party§!

But §WValery Sablin§! knows that the Soviet Union was truly destroyed in 1924, when §yNikolai Bukharin§! won the power struggle to succeed Lenin and began dismantling everything that Lenin had stood for.\n\n§WSablin§! didn't always think this way. He used to be a dutiful commissar in Yagoda's army. He'd served valiantly in the §yCentral Siberian War§!, despite constant §RNKVD§! interference in his unit. He was a lifelong believer in the ideals of Lenin, and for most of his life he believed that §RYagoda§! and his §RPresidium§! upheld them. But as the years dragged on and the §RNKVD§! tightened their grip on the Soviet state, §WSablin§! began to doubt he was truly fighting for the liberation of the proletariat after all. He was not alone. He soon began to meet others who questioned §RYagoda§! and his growing §Rsecurocracy§!. He met §GBuryats§! who felt their culture was being destroyed by assimilationist policies, §GBukharinites§! who felt that an §RNKVD securocracy§! was antithetical to §yBukharin's§! Union, and he met §Gwomen§! who felt that their equal share of the socialist society was refused to them because of their sex. He united these and other disparate groups together to launch a §GRevolution§! against §RYagoda§!, seizing control of §WBuryatia§! in the process. Alongside §WMikhail Markheev§!, Buryat commander of the army, §WOtto Braun§!, German communist and veteran of Mao's communist uprising in China, §WMaya Ulanovskaya§!, Russian-Jewish dissident and political activist and his right-hand woman §WSusana Pechuro§!, dissident and survivor of the Gulag, he prepares to end §RYagoda's§! tyranny once and for all.\n\nYet, after the §GRevolution§!, what next? §WSablin§! is completely committed to liberating the Union and bringing freedom and equality to all Russians. §WSablin§! has also never governed a polity.

Oblast.\n\nWhen Moscow fell to the §RNazi§! invasion, General-Secretary §wNikolai Bukharin§! disappeared. The §WPresidium of the Supreme Soviet§! quickly elected §GNKVD§! Director §WGenrikh Yagoda§! as their provisional leader. The wise §WYagoda§! wasted no time in saving the Presidium. In a daring escape, his §GNKVD§! motorized divisions managed to spirit the Soviet government away to the East across old Siberian Plan infrastructure to the city of §WIrkutsk§!. Upon arrival, the §WPresidium§! tried to reassert control over the old Union, but few believed the old Bukharin government was relevant in the new Russia. The government began to lose their grip on the Far-East as military §Rstrongmen§!, native Siberian §Rreactionaries§!, and §rfascist§! collaborator "§RHeirs of Harbin§!" carved out their own slice of the Far-East for themselves. The latest blow to the Soviet state is the insurrection of §RValery Sablin§! in Buryatia. Formerly a loyal soldier, §RSablin§! has shown his true colors as a §Rutopian left-deviationist ultra§! seeking to remake the §GSoviet Union§! in his naive and puerile image.\n\nThis decline is, in the eyes of §WGeneral-Secretary Yagoda§!, directly attributable to the incompetence of the §WPresidium§!. Their beloved §wBukharin§! failed the Soviet Union and his toadies are repeating all of his mistakes. §WYagoda§! has thus begun empowering his loyal §GNKVD§! ever since the evacuation. While previously a secret police service, the §GNKVD§! has assumed more and more functions of the Soviet §GState§! over time. §WYagoda's§! §Rdetractors§! in the Party, often referred to as §Rthe Party faction§! and led by §RSergey Bessonov§!, allege that §WYagoda§!

When the §RGermans§! invaded, however, all differences had to be thrown aside. Bound together by the influence of §WFather Janis Mendriks§! and the knowledge that, if neither worked with the other, all would perish, the guards and prisoners embarked on a long trek southwards, leaving only the worst of their ranks behind.

When the Second World War ended, the steel mills closed and the mountain lay dormant. But §WDoctor Trofim Lysenko§! and the §W22nd NKVD Motor Rifle Division§! arrived, transforming the former network of mines into a base of operations where few entered and even fewer returned. The locals soon gave Mount Magnitnaya a new name more befitting of its ominous reputation: §Wthe Black Mountain§!.\n\nFar beneath the mountain's surface, §WTrofim Lysenko§! continues the "scientific" work that he started more than three decades prior. He has rejected the concepts of Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution, considering them to be classist lies that falsely apply the capitalist theory of competition to nature. In reality, Mother Nature is a socialist and all things trend toward cooperation. Any rational scientist would call his theories Lamarckian pseudoscience, but they have long since been forced out of academia or purged from his clique of technocrats.\n\nPushed by the stress of his experienced, §WLysenko§! has realized that there is no boundary worth respecting when the future of socialism is on the line, and he has broken one of his few taboos: human experimentation. He has become desperate to apply his theories in the creation of a "New Soviet Man," something that the unfortunate residents of §WMagnitogorsk§! have learned firsthand.\n\nThose who aid in the kidnapping of test subjects are the §WNKVD§!, led by §WStepan Bunkov§!. Their path first crossed with the mad scientist's in the closing days of the Second World War, when they were charged with evacuating him and his research well behind the front lines.

It was here that the ideas of a Rooseveltian New Deal burned, as comparisons to the failures of the Soviets' Nikolai Bukharin's own doings left the ideas unpopular and unsupported. And it was here that §BAl Smith§! came on top for the §BDemocrats,§! allowing for then-incumbent President §SHerbert Hoover§! to maintain his stay in the White House.\n\nWith 1936, however, things changed for the §MUnited States,§! §BJoseph P. Kennedy§! promised an administration of balance and isolation, seeking to tip toe away from the breaking out of war in Europe by the §RNazi,§! despite the constant pleas from allied states. Peace and abstention reigned in North America, allowing the country to maneuver a recovery from the Great Depression and bolster the American economy; however, calm and stability hath reigned not. For, on December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy, §Mthe United States of America§! was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the §xEmpire of Japan,§! crippling §Mthe United States'§! fleet as it rested in §WPearl Harbor.§!\n\nWith a navy on the retreat and a new President to take hold, President §BHarry S. Truman§! promised the American people that they would see the Beacon of Liberty push through for the cause of democracy, a promise which sunk to the depths of the Pacific on July 4th, 1945, as a flash of light consumed the island of §YHawaii§! upon the dropping of an atomic bomb on the previously attacked §WPearl Harbor.§! To make matters worse, late August saw the signing of the §xAkagi Accords,§! officially ending the war with the first great American defeat in history, as it signed away the state of §YHawaii§! and the naval bases of Los Angeles and San Francisco to §xJapanese§! control, alongside endless amounts of reparations to pay and the lifting of embargoes to Axis-aligned states. The chaotic 1948 elections saw §SThomas Dewey§! signed trump the embarrassed §BDemocrats§! over a reeling nation, having to deal with the planting of seeds towards the new political paths of §Mthe United States§!. In the first post-war election, an angry and bitter §MAmerican§! populace almost unanimously turned their backs upon the ruling §BDemocratic Party.§!\n\nFacing waves of defections to the Republicans and the loss of nearly all of their senate seats, the party desperately sought a way to survive. Ultimately, a radical solution was proposed by several former §BDemocrats§!-turned-§wRepublicans§! such as Senator §TLyndon B. Johnson§! – a union with the now triumphant §wRepublican§! Party. After much political wrangling, the two parties were united to form the §wRepublican§!-§BDemocratic§! Party, briefly turning America into a one-party state.\n\nThus, the legendary General §SDwight D.

However, with the final declaration of §SEisenhower's§! intent to oversee §YHawaii's§! reintroduction into the §MUnion§! against the §xAkagi Accords,§! the §MUnited States§! has firmly entrenched its position in the dangerous world of today, whilst new, rising political stars come to sit in the most powerful seats of the country. Now, as we look forward into the 1960s, President §SRichard Milhous Nixon§! and Vice President §BJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy,§! son of former President §BJoseph P.

As the American Depression wore on and the matter of civil rights began to enter the public consciousness, some Americans began to turn to alternative voices to represent their grievances. The §PNational Progressive Front§! formed by Henry A. Wallace and Glen Taylor in 1947 became a beacon of progressivism, while George S. Patton's §LPatriotic Party§! was established in 1951 to represent hard-line conservative interests. Both were able to carry states in the elections of 1952 and 1956, but neither could unseat the §wRepublican§!-§BDemocrats.§! In the interests of presenting a united anti-establishment voice, the two parties made the controversial decision to unite under one banner – the §ONational Progressive Party§! – though whether this Frankenstein of a political movement can have an impact remains to be seen.\n\n§YWhere We're At Now:§!\nIn the year 1962, §RRichard Nixon§! is President of the §MUnited States of America.§! Fortunately, his work is cut out for him: Americans from coast to coast desire social reform at all levels. A new crisis is brewing in enemy-controlled §YHawaii§! as the aggressive §xJapanese§! place nuclear missiles on the island chain. Racism runs rampant across the South as African Americans plead for the Civil Rights Act to be signed, while many white Southerners fiercely oppose the Act.

In the face of §BPresident Kennedy's§! inaction, the very same zeal had pushed the §BDemocrat§! Congressman, and his like-minded colleagues, into the §wGrand Old Party's§! welcoming embrace. Yet it was also he who had convinced his new colleagues to caucus with his old party's tatters in 1952. For having helped restore their strength, the §wRepublicans§! and §BDemocrats§! rewarded the man who was one of both their own with the Senate leadership - an iron gauntlet he has since bloodied against dissenters and rivals alike, to great effect.

Until the §YGermans§! came. As their panzers rolled over the mighty Maginot and into Paris, we saw them as liberators, a nation that finally symphatized with the sorry fate of Bretons. Well, we were almost correct.\n\nAs the Second World War ended, Brittany had not achieved the liberty we had hoped §YHitler§! would grant us. Still under French rule, the future looked bleak. But history has a funny way of giving every cloud a silver lining. The cloud in question was dark purple, and §YHeinrich Himmler§! was the wind. In an ironic twist of fate, Brittany's greatest contemporary existential threat was the very same that caused us to finally gain freedom, as Brittany gained nominal independence in the wake of the formation of §YBurgundy§!.\n\nThough the lot of the Bretons looked to be improving, the world had different plans. As the Reich plummeted into economic chaos, the various client states, Brittany included, were left largely to their fates. As starvation and poverty loomed, it was §YOlier Mordrel§! who would first suggested the unthinkable; Brittany would have to turn to §YBlack Market trading§! in order to survive. While many worried about the impact government-sponsored crimes would have on the moral fiber of Bretons, the results could not be argued with. Brittany was not only saved, but by becoming a pipeline for Western goods into the Reich, we began acquiring wealth beyond our wildest dreams.\n\nThe Bretons have been through a lot, but our spirits were never broken. As the New Year's celebrations come to an end, and 1962 begins, the Breton republic looks into the future with eagerness, but also doubts. While the §YBlack Market§! shows much promise for the future of Brittany, Breton intelligence sources indicate that the deteriorating health of §YAdolf Hitler§! is the source of increasing power struggles within Germany. Any internal conflicts within Germany could negatively impact Brittany.

 COUNTRY_INFO_1_YUN: "§G==YUNNAN==§!\n\nTo look at the state of §WYunnan§!, nestled in the far southwest of §WChina§! west of §WGuangxi§! and south of §WSichuan§!, one must first understand the aftermath of the defeat at §WChongqing§!.\n\nThe final victory of §RJapan§! in the §Rbattle of Chongqing§! severely damaged the morale of the §MUnited Front forces§! in §WYunnan§!. This combined with the fall of §WSoutheast Asia§! under §RJapanese control§!, cutting the supply routes, meant that there was no way §WYunnan§! could stand against §RJapan§! without completely ravaging the land.\n\n§gLong Yun§!, having ruled §WYunnan§! as its "King" for years, was no fool; he knew better than to force the people of §WYunnan§! to die in a meaningless battle. §RJapan§!, on the other hand, was not willing to step foot in §WYunnan§!. Though they had won at §WChongqing§!, they were at their limit: they were only barely able to occupy §WSichuan§!, and terrain and supply issues were enough to drive them out of §WGuangxi§! - let alone the even more impassable province of §WYunnan§!. So then both sides came to terms in order to avoid pointless bloodshed - but there was one variable that had yet to be resolved, that of §gLong Yun's§! status.\n\n§gLong Yun§! was far too influential in §WYunnan§! after years of his reign; he knew §RJapan§! would be angry at the prospect of his continued rule. Moreover, his relationship with §OWang Jingwei§! was difficult since that fateful day when §OWang§! had escaped to §WHanoi§! from §WYunnan§! under §gLong Yun's§! eyes, something that §gLong§! had regretted for the rest of his life. That led him to conclude that §OWang§! too would oppose any plan to let him stay in power.\n\nTherefore, he resigned and passed the throne to his cousin §gLu Han§!, who was optimal for both sides of the conference table. Being less powerful and influential made him acceptable to §RJapan§!; to §gLong Yun§!, he was his cousin and longtime comrade-in-arms whom he could trust fully in all §WYunnan§! matters. Just as good was the fact that §gLu Han§! had no ties to the Nanjing government. §gLu Han§! himself, once violently opposed to any concept of peace with §RJapanese imperialists§!, was more willing to compromise after being shaken by the §rIJA's atrocities§! during the War.\n\nBut §gLu Han's§! ascension did not solve everything. After all, §gLong Yun§! was too connected to §WYunnan's§! administration and his removal would cause massive unrest among citizens, tribes and the remnants of the military. Therefore, a compromise was reached: §gLong Yun§! would remain in the cabinet as ceremonial head of government, his cousin's second-in-command. As the new head of state, §gLu Han§! officially signed a ceasefire and surrendered to the §h'National Government of China'§! instead of §RJapan§! itself; this made sense given that with Chiang's death the §hNanjing puppet-government§! was the only Chinese government that remained.\n\nThis arrangement has persisted for a decade and more. On the Gregorian New Year of 1962, §gLu Han§! remains in power, his hold apparently secure; in fact, he is increasingly bedevilled by §Ydissent and insurgencies§!, and the people are nowhere near as satisfied as they could be."

 COUNTRY_INFO_2_YUN: "==THE DETERIORATION==\n\nWhy has the reign of §gLu Han§! gone from a fairly popular facsimile of §gLong Yun's§! rule to one bedevilled by §Ydissent and popular anger§!? Several reasons exist.\n\nFirst, the long period of peace has corroded §gLu Han's§! formerly strongly nationalist spirit: so long as §GNanjing§! keeps to its promises of autonomy for him, he has no problem with continuing to collaborate anymore.\n\nSecond, close relationships and gifts from the §Glocal landlords§! - at best a conflict of interest, and at worst flat-out bribery - make him less and less concerned about the welfare of the "hundred surnames" - the average people - of §WYunnan§!. Or at least that is what people see.\n\nIn actuality, §WLu§! has no choice. With §Ranti-Japanese insurgencies§! gaining ground across the whole province, §WLu's§! rule is growing more unstable; compromises and concessions must be made to his overlord in §GNanjing§! and the powerful local grandees to preserve even a modicum of stability. But while that may excuse §gLu's§! behaviour in the eyes of an external observer, it is not obvious; for that reason among others, it does not make the misery of the poor or the offended patriotism of §WYunnan's§! soldiers any less bitter. Nor does it afford him any sympathy.\n\nThird, §GPresident Gao Zongwu's modernization program§! is in full swing. If §GGao§! is to afford the humongous costs he must pull money from any place he can. Accordingly, he, supported by §RJapan§!, demands ever-higher tributes from the §Wwarlords§! on his peripheries. §gLu Han§! has not unreasonably taken this as a golden opportunity to prove his loyalty. So he exploits the §WYunnan§! people more and more brutally in the name of the welfare of §WChina§!. This has of course made him look a lot better in the eyes of §GNanjing§! and §RTokyo§!, affording him even more autonomy. (Deep down §gLu§! does realize that all his harsh methods are to help §WChina§! break its chains and become free at long last. But this is not obvious to most. Nor, for that matter, is it sufficient to assuage the misery of §WYunnan's§! oppressed people.)\n\nNo one who knows the situation as stated above is surprised when they hear that the former King of Yunnan, §gLong Yun§!, now second-in-command of the provincial government, is not happy at all. He feels that his cousin has fallen hard from grace and is no longer the honorable man he once respected.\n\nWith §YChina's weak army§! and §RJapan's increasing collapse§!, Long Yun believes that a chance to pressure §GNanjing§! to treat §WXinan§! better by force is coming ever-closer. As §gLong Yun's§! position is ceremonial, he lacks the authority to truly push the central government – not that the §RJapanese§! would allow it anyway. But that doesn't leave him powerless – not only is he still highly prestigious in §WXinan§!, but there are the §Yinsurgents§!... who just might be able to lend him a hand when the time comes.\n\n==FEATURES==\n\n- Continue with Lu Han's contribution to the Modernizations.\n\n- Read the life story of important dissenters against Lu Han's rule.\n\n- Await the coming of a movement that might fizzle out, leave the §xwhole nation in misery§!, or §Mfree China§!."

Hitler became the lynchpin of this glory and to this day his name is written with any mention of it, alongside §Rthose innumerable crimes committed in the process§!. What followed was a decade of prosperity and power, where the Reich stood as the unquestioned hegemon of the world - and utter despair and tragedy in the years after, where the people saw it all crumble to dust.

Today, he not only stands as, effectively, the spokesman of the §rNSDAP§!, but as the face of the §WReich's§! conservative movement, heartily preaching the values of §rNational Socialism§! and only suggesting minor changes to curb corruption and inefficiency, in contrast to §OSpeer's§! reformism and §gGöring's§! militarism. With his close ties to §rHitler§!, his relative dominance over the §rReichstag§!, and his track record as a loyal supporter of §rNational Socialism§!, §LBormann§! is widely regarded in international circles as the most likely successor to the §rFührership§!.

One of the original members of the §rNSDAP§!, §gGöring§! commands respect in the way that few others can. With the conservative wing of the Party already firmly under §LBormann's§! control, §gGöring§! turned to the §rHeer§!, quickly aligning just over half of the armed forces to his view.

Whether he could pull off all he promises, however, remains to be seen.\n\n§OAlbert Speer§!\nDepending on who you ask, §OAlbert Speer§! is either the man who can save the §WReich§! or the man who will destroy it.

It seemed almost inevitable that it would grow to join the ranks of the §Wburgeoning superpowers§! of the §RUnited States§!, §RGreater German Reich§!, and §REmpire of Japan§!. A fourth superpower, bound tightly in friendship to §RGermany§!, which would surely see the spread of §WFascism§! world wide.\n\nThe fifties saw this dream of §GMussolini§!'s transform into a nightmare from which the country still has not yet fully woken. Strong Armed into aiding with the §RAtlantropa Project§! by §RGermany§!, §GItaly§!'s coast was ravaged, and the §Wadriatic destroyed§!, making way for nigh-useless §Wsalt plains§!. The §Weconomic crash§! that swept from §RGermany§! into Europe decimated §GItaly§!'s struggling economy - and then, finally, when the §RGermans§! had the gall to attempt to drag §GItaly§! into a war against a resurgent §RRussia§!, §GMussolini§! had decided §GItaly§! would no more suffer under German treachery. The §GEmpire§! would withdraw from its alliance with §RGermany§! - and open its borders to those in the Reich that sought refuge. Political prisoners, escaped prisoners, and more fled to §GItaly§!.\n\nAs the fities wore on, §GMussolini§!'s decisions grew more erratic and unpredictable as the Duce aged. He moved against the King, §GUmberto II di Savoia§!, and very nearly plunged the country into civil war in an attempt to depose the monarchy. The only thing stopping him was his son-in-law, §GGaleazzo Ciano§!.\n\nA devout Fascist, §GCiano§! had nevertheless watched with growing horror as §GMussolini§!'s policies plunged the §GEmpire§! into greater economic ruin and political strife. He stepped in between the King and the Duce's political rivalry, convincing his father-in-law to forfeit the struggle to end the monarchy; some say the Duce's death some days later was a mere coincidence, some say §GCiano§! took the safety of §GItaly§! into his own hands. Whatever the case, il Duce was dead, and §GCiano§! had risen to take his place.\n\nThe New Duce's immediately began to liberalize the §GEmpire§!, not out of any dedication to §WDemocracy§!, but out of sheer pragmatism. §WFascism§!, at least the methods of it §GMussolini§! had employed, had failed. §GCiano§!'s reforms walked back on racial laws, brutal colonial systems, and, perhaps most importantly, the suppression of Italian §WDemocracy§!. Spurred on by King §GUmberto II§!, the Duce has slowly but surely began to reintroduce democratic systems to §GItaly§!'s people, and even as the hardliners in the PNF bluster and grumble, the masses of §GItaly§! have begun to turn away from §WFascism§!.\n\nYet this bloodless Revolution may yet fail. §GCarlo Scorza§!, the ad-hoc leader of the hardliners of the PNF, stands firmly against §GCiano§!'s reforms, blocking them when possible and causing public outcry when not.

 COUNTRY_INFO_IRE: "§G==THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND==§!\n\nThe twentieth century opened in a dark time for the people of §GIreland§!, subjugated as they were by their overlords in §RLondon§!. But circumstance and stubbornness allowed the §GIrish§! to have a state of their own once more, and for a time it seemed as though peace would be the way of things between the §REnglish§! and their §Gformer subject§!. Then, the §qGerman Reich§! attacked. Through Warsaw, Paris and even London itself did the German boot march, and §YÉamon de Valera§!, Prime Minister, leader of §LFianna Fáil§! and the Irish Hero, was faced with the choice of siding with a §Rdoomed power§! or making §Gthe republic's§! place in the §gnew world order§! assured through blood.\n\nThe §Yde Valera§! administration authorised the §GIrish§! invasion with §gGerman§! assistance, of the region known as §ONorthern Ireland§!, the only part of the §GEmerald Isle§! kept under §SBritish rule§!. On the back of a successful albeit bloody and long campaign, §LFianna Fáil§! hasn't merely come to dominate §GIrish§! politics over the past decades and has effectively become the sole ruling party. §cFine Gael§! has withered on the vine, whilst the socialist §eSinn Féin§! was banned outright. Yet not everyone is content with the state of affairs, especially §GIrish§! membership in the German dominated §qEinheitspakt§!. Following the withdrawal of the German garrisons from the North at the time of the West Russian War, control over the §ONorthern Counties§! became increasingly difficult, necessitating the appointment of §YNeil Blaney§! as Minister for the Northern Counties. Through methods unknown to much of the government, he has maintained the boiling pot that is the region under control.\n\n§LFF§! dominance waned during the tumultuous times of the 50's, and whilst §Yde Valera§! is well liked by the average Irishman there were many who began to tire of his rule as once small mistakes began to pile up slowly but surely. Thus when §LSeán Lemass§! suggested that §Yde Valera§! take the more ceremonial position of the presidency where he could retain influence still, it was a trivial issue for the old man to accept, though he cautioned §LLemass§! not to coalition with §SLabour§!. It must have come as an unpleasant surprise to the elderly revolutionary when the new Prime Minister did exactly that and formed the current government as a §LFF§!-§SLabour§! coalition, with de Valera powerless to stop it. And in the midst of this disagreement §LFF§! has started to show even more vulnerability than before.\n\nNow after a disappointingly narrow victory in the '61 elections, three factions of §LFF§! stand to contest the parties future. The §LDe Valerists§!, supporters of the conservative old guard and §YLemass§!'s support base. The §qHardliners§! of the aforementioned §YNeil Blaney§!, Catholic supremacists who are disliked fervently by the north, and §YJack Lynch§!'s awkwardly named §TLiberals§!. Who despite having little in common with the ideology are nonetheless the most reform minded of §LFF§!.\n\nWhile these factions spatter over mundane politics, the situation in the §ONorthern Counties§!, the largely protestant former British territories, continues to degrade. Few have taken well to §YNeil Blaney§!'s governance, and terrorism is rife from §OUlster§! to §ODerry§!. Three factions continue to gather strength under the noses of Dublin: The newest amongst these is the §yIrish Citizen Guard§!, a secretive splinter group of the IRA, which is known to be aligned with the interests of Germany. There is also the §eIrish Republican Army§!, an alliance of Irish nationalist and socialist groups opposed to German interference, and led by Seamus Twomey. Finally, there is the §OUlster Volunteer Force§!, a force opposed equally to Irish and German rule, led by the popular presbysterian preacher, §OIan Paisley.§!\n\nIn 1962 §GIreland§! has a future uncertain set before it, one can say it has two visions for the future: Fianna Fáil's vision of status quo and stability or the vision of change of Fine Gael. Only good governance and luck could save a nation so economically dominated by the interests of the §gReich§! and so politically torn on the inside. But perhaps the world will find a way to bring this about.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n- Manage §LFianna Fáil§!'s inner affairs through all the means possible to avoid internal instability or finally bring §lchange§! to the country's political life.\n\n- Lift §GIreland§! out of poverty without running out of budget and the investors's trust.\n\n- Handle the ticking time bomb that is §ONorthern Ireland§! as wisely as you can."

 COUNTRY_INFO_NORWAY: "§j==REICHSKOMMISSARIAT NORWEGEN==§!\n\nStretching into the distant north far beyond the metropole of the §qReich§! lies its northern outpost, §jReichskommissariat Norwegen§!, the dark highways of the Autobahn cutting through its picturesque fjord valleys. Secured in 1940 as a "protectorate against British invasion" by a vast combined arms operation by the Wehrmacht, their control of the Kingdom of Norway would prove a persistent headache for the §qGerman§! government both during and after the war. Unlike their more cooperative cousins in Denmark, Norwegian civilians and military alike proved far less apathetic to the §qGerman§! intervention even in the early years of the occupation, a problem compounded by the consistent failure of the Wehrmacht to capture the King and cabinet in 1940, the royal family and leading politicians escaping with the remnants of their Navy to Scotland. Without anyone to sign a formal surrender, the unstable military administration of von Falkenhorst would prove unable to effectively cope with continued civil disobedience and increasing partisan and commando activity from the locals.\n\nThe solution was a compromise government with a power sharing agreement with the judicial, executive and later legislative branches of government controlled by the native §oNational Unity (NS) Party§!, led by Minister-President Vidkun Quisling. The Reichskommissar supposed to oversee §jNorway's§! eventual integration into the §qReich§!, Joseph Terboven, was much to his chagrin left with little power besides that of the veto and the ability to pass executive orders.\n\nAfter the war, Terboven was able to leverage §jRK Norwegen's§! contribution to the §qGerman§! nuclear program into solidifying his position, but Germanization was still limited due to the native Parliament (the Storting) ousting Quisling for his lies about the Germans withdrawing after the war and failure to secure the Kola peninsula for §jNorwegen§! in the peace settlement. A few short-lived Minister-Presidents later the §jNS§! coalesced around the new Riksfører, Gulbrand Lunde.\n\nFor twenty years, the shaky government has tried its best to turn Norway into a §Ymodel colony§!, led by an equally shaky triumvirate consisting of Terboven, the increasingly disloyal nationalist Gulbrand Lunde, and the brutal police chief Jonas Lie. Lie is a useful tool for Terboven to contain the popularity and resentment of Lunde, since the executive branch would be seriously hampered without a police force to enforce their edicts. However, with mounting challenges from the moderate reformer and agrarian firebrand Per Borten, the traditional rural heartland Lunde's support is rooted in is eroding, and he feels pressured to take an increasingly hardline stance against the §qGermans§! he secretly loathes. Should the §qGerman§! garrison be forced to withdraw, it is uncertain if Lie could maintain the status quo even with brute force, and it is even less certain if Lunde would even be bothered to try to maintain his servile facade without the threat of the garrison. The Germans have made multiple attempts to assassinate him over the years as an intervention against his harkening back to the nationalist days of the party, but always failed and the status quo restored, giving Lunde a firm grit of what power remains to him. Should a crisis emerge between Lie's national socialist true believers and Borten's local nationalists, there is no telling if Borten might make a move to cement his own position as Riksfører for §jNS§!, or worse, the partisans of the §dMilorg§!, military organization, could make a play of their own to kick down the feet under the collaboration government. A remnant of Old Norway and at the same had to catch as an adult, the lion prepares.\n\nThe §Ymodel colony§! is very much a house of cards, one watched with increasing worry by the many §qGerman§! settlers in regions like the Trondheim area as the winds of change pick up in §qGermania§!.\n\nAll three factions must be kept an eye on in the event of disaster. Who will eventually rule Norway remains to be seen."

 COUNTRY_INFO_1_BRA: "§G==REPÚBLICA DOS ESTADOS UNIDOS DO BRASIL==§!\n\nThe Southern Juggernaut, the §wRepublic of the United States of Brazil§!, the largest country in South America and perhaps the strongest, it's always had the potential to be a great power, but all ships are sunk by their sailors. Consumed by a cycle of instability following the coup by a small clique of officers that ended the §nBrazilian Empire§! and birthed the §CFirst Republic§!, the Republic was plagued by corruption and was largely a cover for oligarch interests with rigged elections, voter harassment, and many other sorts of injustices that did nothing but deeply divide the nation to a breaking point which appeared in the form of the §nRevolution of 1930§!.\n\nBacked by an alliance of the opposition, reformists, and disgruntled military officers, §LGetúlio Vargas§! was thrust into power with the mandate of restoring stability to a broken Brazilian nation, thus starting the §LVargas Era§!. With the Revolution successfully deposing the First Republic, §LVargas§! focused on repairing the damage of the Great Depression, suppressing the oligarchs, and restoring order to §nBrazil§!. Dissolving Congress until the adoption of the 1934 Constitution, §LVargas§! had to face not one, not two, but three Revolutions and putschs by §YConstitutionalists§!, §eCommunists§!, and §jFascists§!, allowing him to consolidate his power and perpetuate his Presidency. Citing instability and internal division, Vargas dissolved the Legislature and invoked emergency executive powers, thus starting the period known as the §sEstado Novo§!, a civic dictatorship under which all parties were banned, dissidents were stamped out, and a massive cult of personality was built around §LVargas§!.\n\nThe beginning of the §WSecond World War§! put international attention on §nBrazil§! as a possible contender, with both the §QAllies§! and the §rAxis§! certainly having tried to bring the nation into their side during the conflict through various means. However, §LVargas§! would keep a policy of pragmatic equal distance between both sides, but it'd be the §rAxis§!' own folly that would force the nation onto the side of the §QAllies§! in 1942 as their submarines began targeting §nBrazilian§! ships in the Caribbean.\n\n§LVargas§! adopting democratization measures while retaining control through political machinations, §nBrazil§! participated in the §WBattle of the Atlantic§!, the §yBrazilian Expeditionary Force§!, led by Marshall §yJoão Baptista Mascarenhas de Morais§! and General §yHenrique Teixeira Lott§!, was sent to §xBritain§! to assist in the defense against the §rGerman Invasion§!, fighting bravely but ultimately having to retreat in shame across the Atlantic with several thousands dead.\n\nWar almost reached the mainland when a tense standoff occurred along the Andes between §xChile§! and all of its neighbors, §nBrazil§! forming a secret mutual defense pact with the former in preparations for a possible conflict. Cooler heads prevailed in the end and the standoff was ended as peace between the §rAxis§! and the §QAllies§! was signed. Although humiliated, §nBrazil§! escaped major consequences for their participation in the War.\n\nWith defeat, §LVargas§! would return to his policies before joining the §QAllies§!: Democratization was stalled once more and §LVargas§! would continue to rule by decree, but political opponents like §mCarlos Lacerda§! and §MAmerican§! involvement began breaking apart his hold over the nation. Despite attempting to mitigate the situation, the situation became unbearable after an assasination attempt on §mLacerda§! was blamed on §LVargas§!, culminating in 1949 with a military coup and a popular uprising. Fleeing to São Paulo under protection of Governor §OAdhemar de Barros§!, §yGeneral Teixeira Lott§! intervened to negotiate an agreement where §LVargas§! was allowed to leave power while keeping his reforms, preventing a military junta from taking over, though the military managed to push for the passing of the §RNational Security Laws§!, banning communists and fascist parties and leaving ground for the military to intervene in political matters.\n\nFollowing the coup and with the end of the §LVargas Era§!, new parties such as the centrist §YPSD§!, the Varguist §VPTB§!, the conservative §QUDN§!, and the populist §OPSP§! were quickly formed with the first elections nearing, these being a close race, but ultimately §QEduardo Gomes§! of the §QUDN§! would come out on top, with §OJoão Café Filho§! of the §OPSP§! as his Vice-President. §QGomes§! sought to cement §nBrazil§!'s democratic institutions and a progressive alignment towards the §MOFN§!, and while §QGomes§! is normally seen as successful, he's also often criticized for a laid back attitude towards military interference and corruption.\n\nIn the 1955 election, the §YPSD§!'s candidate §YJuscelino Kubitschek§! was able to come out on top, cementing a political coalition with the §VPTB§! as §VJoão Goulart§!, was also able to win the Vice-Presidency. Despite their victory, the tensions mounting up to the election led to §mCarlos Lacerda§! and §jPlinio Salgado§! refusing to accept the results, causing both groups to begin plans for a coup. Becoming aware of the potential danger, §yMarshall Lott§! moved, routing the §jIntegralists§! and forcing §jSalgado§! into exile, §mLacerda§! backing away to lick his wounds, all while §yLott§!'s popularity soared.\n\nThe 1960 elections saw the defender of democracy, §yMarshall Lott§!, running under a joint §YPSD§!-§VPTB§! ticket. Despite his popularity, the race ultimately still proved close with the §QUDN§! coming close in second place, but §OAdhemar de Barros§! taking a good portion of the vote from the latter. The real shock was the result of the Vice-Presidential race: §QJanio Quadros§! of the §QUDN§! "swept" the polls of his opponents. Now, two very different men of two very different political backgrounds must make their relationship work for the future of §nBrazil§!, lest political turmoil threaten to consume the nation again."

It became a fire-forged alliance after having to face a failed coup. Since then, and under the auspices of Getúlio Vargas, the Coalition has formalized and become more than just a mere electoral ticket, with the parties voting together on key issues, campaigning together, and watching each other's back for their shared common interest.\n\n\n£BRA_PSD_logo_bar\n\n\n\nThe §YPSD§! is a liberal party seeking to represent the centrist current of Brazilian politics aligned with Varguism.

A retired Army Marshall, he participated in the defense of the British Isles during the Second World War. Back home, he was a staunch supporter of Vargas in the Army, and was the one who negotiated between the latter and the Army for a peaceful transition of power in 1949, himself becoming the figurehead of the Constitutionalist Faction in the military. Preventing a coup from occurring in 1955, he became known as the "Defender of Brazilian Democracy", a title which saw him thrust into the §YPSD§!-§VPTB§! ticket in 1960 on the back of his semi-legendary status. His Presidency so far has been a moderate one, although it has continued the policies of his predecessor, it's had to face labor unrest and the recent outbreak of the §WLobster War§!.\n\n§YJuscelino Kubitschek§!\nThe former President of Brazil and the public smiling face of the §YPSD§!.

 REGIONAL_INFO_WEST_RUSSIA: "§G==WEST RUSSIA==§!\n\nWhen the §GSoviet Union§! of Bukharin collapsed, the Germans thought the Russians broken and defeated. Reichskommissariat Moskowien was established on Russia's traditional heartland, home of its most important population center. The weak and cowardly Red Army would dissolve into irrelevance, and let the Germans build their thousand year empire at their leisure.\n\nThe §RWest Russian War§! came as a surprise. A thousand kilometer long offensive by the §GWest Russian Revolutionary Front§! of §GGrand Marshal Voroshilov§!, led by some of the best generals of the fallen Union. Commanders such as §GGeorgy Zhukov§! and §GMikhail Tukhachevsky§! pushed the complacent Germans hard, breaking their line in several areas. For a moment, the whole of RK Moskowien seemed lost.\n\nThis moment passed, and the §RWest Russian War§! took a turn for the tragic. No one within the §GWRRF§! could agree what had cost them the initiative. Russian collaborating with the Reich; incompetence within the front itself; treachery from politicians in §WSyktyvkar§!. No matter the cause, the WRRF's offensive stalled out. The §RWehrmacht§! fought back desperately, slowly turning the tide against the Red Army. In this they were aided by collaborators, men flocking to the banner of the imperial pretender §WVladimir III§! and to the so-called §GArmy of Russian Liberation§! of §WAndrey Vlasov§!. Little by little the front was pushed back, until collapse.\n\nNow West Russia Remains as it was in the months following the end of the West Russian War, frozen in place by the Luftwaffe's cruel §Rterror bombing§! Campaign. In the north near §GArkhangelsk§! the remnants of the WRRF endure. Ageing Grand Marshal Voroshilov is expected to choose a successor; his likeliest candidates are Marshals Tukhachevsky and Zhukov. Sent to govern the military districts of Plesetsk and Ukhta, the generals' absence has done little to change court politics in Arkhangelsk proper. To the south of the Front's holdings lies the §GKomi Republic§!, a democracy born from a secessionist province of the Front. President Voznesensky has managed to steer the young nation mostly successfully, yet increasing political instability from the far left and far right threaten the republic. Nevertheless, Komi holds a few trump cards of its own and is a contender for power in the region.\n\nSouth of the Front and west of Komi can be found §GVologda and Gorky§!. Once men of the Front, the soldiers in Vologda rebelled at the thought of continuing to fight fellow Russian soldiers. Since then they've attempted to sail a perilous course of diplomacy. Gorky is home to some of the front's veteran armored divisions. Isolated from their former commanders, the men of Gorky live as bandits and raiders.\n\nFurther south can be found Vyatka and Samara. Captured by German collaborators in the dying day of the West Russian war, both regions hope to use their veteran armies to secure control of West Russia. The tsarists in §GVyatka§! at least hold on to imperial dignity, being led by the legitimate Romanov heir Vladimir III. Their rivals in §GSamara§! have nothing in the world but their own force of arms. Widely despised for their efforts to help the Germans win the §RWest Russian War§!, the men of the Russian Army of Liberation are cut off from their families west, and unsure as to their next objective.\n\nOther nation states try to carefully eke out a living in the ashes and ruins created by the endless German bombings. In §GBashkiria and in Tatarstan§!, the local population waried of the resumption of a new Russian Civil war hope to be spared by the rising winds of war. In §WOnega§! the men of the §GAnti-Communist Volunteer Guard§! continue their endless watch.

Whilst the Reich brews in its own hotbed of sycophancy, betrayal, and competition for succession in lieu of the Führer's impending demise, a §PState of Shadow§! lies due west, biding its time, watching each and every move of the many states across Europe, plotting its own machinations in the wake of disenchantment from the Reich's failures. And the §POrdensstaat§! only has so much time left to accomplish its mark upon this corrupted world..."
 
 REGIONAL_INFO_ENGLAND: "§G==BRITISH ISLES==§!\n\nAn empire long united must divide. And an empire long divided must unite. The United Kingdom of §PGreat Britain and Northern Ireland§! is no more, the horrors of World War 2 and the §gGerman§! Invasion sundering the nation apart.\n\nChief of the nations in former §PGreat Britain§! still is §xEngland§!. Though once at the head of an empire which spanned the globe, in the modern era §xEngland§! has fallen on hard times. The collaborationist government of the §gRoyal Party§!, a loose alliance of those unwilling to risk the ire of Germania, governs the country in a decidedly undemocratic manner. Nonetheless, under the leadership of §gAlec Douglas-Home§!, the collaborationists have managed to piece together a functional administration for the first time in years. Yet not all the men of §xEngland§! submit to the §gGerman§! yoke. Her Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance, the §eHMMLR§!, are the foremost group in the struggle against fascism. A mix of communists, monarchists and everything in between, §eHMMLR§! is united almost solely by their mutual antipathy for the collaborationists and all who serve them. But the balance between these two groups is precarious, and who knows what could happen should the international stage move erratically?\n\nIn the north the §MRepublic of Scotland§! holds out as the last truly democratic nation in the isles. Formed not by treaty but by the rogue Field Marshal Wimberley and John MacCormick's §YScottish National Party§! as a last bid to ward off advancing §gGerman§! forces, §MScotland§! is an eclectic mix of exiles, natives and soldiers that share only their hatred of the Reich and all who serve her in common. Yet despite existing for nigh on two decades the Republic is fundamentally unstable, riven by divides between nationalists, unionists and other parties still. The future of Scotland is dependent on that of §xEngland§!, and whether an independent Scotland is the future or a blip on the historical radar is yet to be seen.\n\nTo the west of §xEngland§! lies the nation of §GWales§!. Forcedly separated from §xEngland§! during the course of the treaty of surrender, the Welsh have attempted to rebuild their nation which hasn't existed in over seven centuries, to varying results. Internally the Welsh are even more split by the matter of unionism than their Scottish brethren, with parties all across the political spectrum holding a variety of opinions on the matter, the only consistent agreement being that a union at present would be disastrous. A potential issue in the future of Wales though might be with their primary export. The coal mines of the Welsh primarily export to §gGermany§! after all, and were something to interrupt this it might prove disastrous for the fledgling celtic nation.\n\nAcross the Irish Sea, the §yRepublic of Ireland§! eeks out a meagre existence as the second of the §gUnity§! §gPakt's§! allies in the British Isles. Aiding the Germans in their conquest of §oNorthern Ireland§! during the course of the Second World War, the Irish have few friends to be found outside the §gPakt's§! influence. With the situation growing ever more unstable in Europe however, the future of the emerald isle is an uncertain one, and is likely to be impacted heavily by whomever emerges victorious in Britain. But the Irish people are not known for giving in to inevitable results, one way or another the English will find that out firsthand when the time comes.\n\nBritain is a land of chaos, a land of unrest, a land of opportunity. Whom shall rise and whom shall fall is left up to those who take power for themselves. Let the winner take all!"
 
 REGIONAL_INFO_EAST_ASIA: "§G==EASTERN ASIA==§!\n\n§MEast Asia§!, a region now free of §RWestern Imperialism§! has a new master - §eThe Empire of Japan§!. With its crushing victories in the Greater East Asia War, the Imperial State commands the loyalty of the liberated nations previously under the colonialist yoke, and the attention of the world. Her warring fury had swept across the east in a marvelous strike of military prowess and imperial strength. However, Tokyo's grip over its new client states is waning, and the §edrums of war§! beat again.\n\nTo her north and west stand the §PEmpire of Manchuria§!, a loyal ally and puppet of the Japanese, and the §wRepublic of China§!, an increasingly rowdy satellite state angered by Tokyo's dominance over the east. To the south, the nations of §RIndonesia, Shonan§!, and various others pay homage to their Japanese allies, but the fires of revolt and rebellion burn louder and faster with each year that passes. Nonetheless, on the surface, Japanese hold of the Pacific is firm and secure, only threatened by the vexed postulations of the Americans in the east and Germans to the west.\n\n§OThe Co-Prosperity Sphere§!, a geopolitical organization set up to hold together Japanese prizes from outside threats, stands tall over Asia to unite the liberated nations under the leadership of the Imperial State. IJA garrisons stand to defend Japan's allies, marching from the banks of the Amur river to the jungles of Bengal, and IJN fleets patrol the eastern waters to guard from foreign incursion.\n\nIt is 1962, and Tokyo rules over The East. The New Order has resettled differences between nations and peoples, with entire civilizations now faced to bear witness to the might of the Rising Sun. However, old habits die hard, and generations will not forget their bitter rivalries with neighboring enemies and resent for their colonial oppressors."

 REGIONAL_INFO_WEST_SIBERIA: "§G==WEST SIBERIA==§!\n\nWith the death of the §GSoviet Union§! came the birth of the §WWest Siberian People's Republic§!, a Bolshevik state headed by the authoritarian §GLazar Kaganovich§!. Assigned to the isolated region under Bukharin, Lazar wove webs and forged alliances that put him at the helm of an iron nation. But with time came vengeance, so when §GWest Russia§! launched its infamous war against the §Rfascist aggressor§!, the Republic stood by. But with war came defeat, bitter loss that took its final toll upon the Russian people. City after city, civilization collapsed into anarchy, out of which arose idealist states and the stuff of nightmares.\n\nThe West Siberian People's Republic was thrown into chaos as well, suffering from a lack of initiative and back-stabbings against Kaganovich's regime. The collapse came with no surprise, fracturing into petty warlords:\n\nIn the center sits the steel city of §GTyumen§!, below which gather armies in preparation for the next war. Smoke bellows from massive factories to the sound of marching feet, soldiers heading in one direction, resettled peasants in the other. §GKaganovich§! and §GKhrushchev§! cling against hope that they may repudiate their past mistakes. But to the North lies a greater adversary - §WSverdlovsk§!, commanded by the aging §GGeneral Konstantin Rokossovsky§!. A father to his men, the military junta wields a powerful army but remains relatively apolitical. In its crosshairs is Tyumen, and next, all of Russia. In the South, hugging the wastes of Kazakhstan, sleeps a monster of great malice. The spartan city of §ROmsk§! extends its bony grip across Western Siberia, rallying men whose mere names conjure fear. Like a chessmaster, the §RBlack League§! calculates its every move, but whispers speak of death and a succession crisis.\n\nHigh atop the mountains sits the §Ymerchant republic of Zlatoust§!. Content with one of the largest military complexes in Russia, the merchants of death help arm the armies which may one day lead to their own demise. But the Republic is also home to innovators, its stability and justice attracts many refugees. New rifles pour from modern assembly lines - anyone who wishes to obtain the treasures of the Mountain will have to come and take it. But Zlatoust is not alone - in the North is the §WThief Territory of Yugra§!. A country without laws, ran by bandits and thugs, Yugra launches constant raids for food and ammunition.\n\nCornered against the icy sea is §WVorkuta§!, remnants of the Vorkutan Corrective Labor camp. One of the largest §RGULAGs§! in Russia, its prisoners freeze before the guards, themselves confined to ancient structures, feeding on scraps. The last 'warlord' are the §WFree Aviators§!, remnants of the Soviet air corps. Unique in its leadership, the Aviators do not have a functioning government - rather, they are a collection of airfields, the last line of defense against the Lufwaffe's endless onslaught. The Aviators command respect from all factions, but their numbers dwindle every day, until there will be none left. Rumours of Hitler's imminent death and the Pakt's collapse may halt the terror bombings, paving the way for a war of national reclamation.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n- Mobilize the industry and rally your armies to rebuild Western Siberia, either under the Crimson flag or the Black League.\n\n- Utilize superior industry to conquer Western Russia when the time is right, but do not forget about the Southern Urals.\n\n- Gear for the inevitable war against Germany."

 REGIONAL_INFO_CENTRAL_SIBERIA: "§G==CENTRAL SIBERIA==§!\n\nCentral Siberia once stood defiantly as the §WCentral Siberian Republic§!, the world's eyes on its capital §WTomsk§! as the young nation strove confidently into the future. Holding most of Russia's remaining industry as a result of Bukharin's Central Siberian Industrial Plan, the Republic was seen as the likeliest candidate for Russian Unification.\n\nIn the end however, it was not German Fascism but the inability of Russians to work together that brought down the nation. Internal strife and a foreign invasion from the East broke the back of the Central Siberian Republic, leaving a myriad of successor states in its wake.\n\nTo the South West, the §WFederation of Novosibirsk and Barnaul§! plots to make good use of its agricultural land and heavy industry to reunite the region. Legendary ace pilot §WPokryshkin§! and his junta had a first row seat to the collapse of the old Republic. They plan not to repeat its mistakes. East of the federation one can find §Wthe Principalty of Kemerovo§!. Led by §WKing Rurik II§!, the small statelet's blend of medieval Russia and modernity leaves many confused. Some write off §WRurik II§! as a mad old fool. Others note that his well ran state and well trained army is likely to play an important part in future events.\n\nEast of §WKemerovo§!, another breakaway state led by a former §WCSR§! general can be found in §WKrasnoyarsk§!. The shaky democracy's future is uncertain; what is clearer is that §WNikolai Andreev§! and his fellow mutineers will fight tooth and nail to maintain their independence. Meanwhile, to the §WPrincipalty's§! south one can find the mountainous §WKarakorum Government of Oyrotia§!. Cut off from the §WCSR's§! central government, the small nation of Altai people and Old Believer refugees have united in their effort to avoid bloodshed and oppression for their religious beliefs.\n\nEast of §WKrasnoyarsk§! lies an expanse of villages and free cities. Imagining the area undefended would however be a dangerous mistake, for the §WSiberian Black Army§! zealously defends the region. Adherents of a particularly militarized variant of anarchism, the leadership of the §WBlack Army§! plots its next moves. All of Russia must be freed from statist oppression, beginning with Central Siberia.\n\nFinally to the north, the rump of the §WCentral Siberian Republic§! controls the city of Tomsk and the vast arctic expanses beyond. Many have written off the city of artists and thinkers as soft, decadent and unable to contend with the loss of a majority of its army to secessions and rebellions. Nevertheless, §WPresident Pasternak§! has not given up. Nearing the end of his life, the Poet President plans to entrust the rump §WCSR§! to a new political elite, one able to restore the §WCentral Siberian Republic§! to greatness.\n\nExhausted by war with the §RRussian Far East§! and civil conflicts for a few years, the rivalries of Central Siberia have begun to rouse the various warlords from their fragile peace. There is only enough room in Central Siberia for one nation, one heir to Bukharin's Industrial Cornucopia. The Soviet era's foundries and factories will cause yet more bloodshed as the unification wars begin!\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n- §WUnite§! the rich Central Siberian region and use it as a springboard to Russian Reunification.\n\n- §WManage§! your share of the Central Siberian industries, expanding it and dealing with worker's rights issues as the regional conflict heats up."

 REGIONAL_INFO_FAR_EAST: "§G==THE FAR EAST==§!\n\nThe §WRussian Far East§! is far and away the least populated region in Russia, and contains some of the most treacherous and hostile landscapes in the continent. The cataclysmic collapse of the §GSoviet Union§! did little to change this state of affairs, and even a far flung region such as this is now home to all manner of warlords seeking to stake their claim to Russia.\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse, §GGenrikh Yagoda§! fled east with the remnants of the Soviet Presidium and reestablished order over the province of §GIrkutsk§!. From there, he has solidified an iron reign over the region that has frequently come into conflict with neighboring rival warlords such as the §RCentral Siberian Republic§!. It was not to last, however, as disaster soon struck.\n\nFrom the Manchurian city of §GHarbin§!, dark forces crossed the Amur and marched north to wage a bloody war of vengeance against §RBolshevism§!. §GKonstantin Rodzaevsky§! and his §GRussian Fascist Party§! were the tip of this invasion's spear, shattering Yagoda's influence in the East and establishing his own regime in the city of Zeya. It wasn't long, however, before Rodzaevsky himself was threatened with collapse.\n\nA "moderate" faction of the RFP led by §GMikhail Matkovsky§! grew disgusted with Rodzaevsky's admiration of the §RNazi invaders§!, and over time came to resent his dogmatic rhetoric. These tensions came to a head, and resulted in Matkovsky's loyalists snatching the key port of §GMagadan§! from Rodzaevsky's grasp. Sensing their chance, §GWhite Army§! remnants based in Harbin secured control over their old stronghold in §GChita§!. With a claimant of their own, one §GMikhail II§!, they plan to restore the monarchy to Russia by whatever means necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, The final threat to §GYagoda's§! power came in the form of a mutiny. Former NKVD officer §GValery Sablin§!, a young and idealistic revolutionary, seized control over the province of §GBuryatia§! and declared an open revolt against Yagoda and the Presidium. As of 1962, this war is still raging, and it is unclear who will come out on top.\n\nTo the north, the region has devolved into total anarchy. Very few have made their homes in this arctic hell, and there is not likely to be much in the way of action here. However, there are scattered rumors amongst the tribes and villages of the north of a §Gpowerful figure§! with the strength to reunify the nation...\n\nThe §WRussian Far East§! is a desolate and bloodsoaked land, and it is not likely to get any better until this wasteland is united once and for all.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n- Defend the last remnant of the Soviet Union, or bring about its destruction.\n\n- Make the most with what you have in a desolate landscape.\n\n- Be wary of §Gthe North§!."

 REGIONAL_INFO_URAL: "§G==SOUTHERN URALS==§!\n\n§WThe Southern Urals§! represent the Russian Anarchy at its best and worst. To the west, §WThe Communes of Orenburg§! constitute thousands of citizens in its anarchic council, while the shrewd management of §WOrenburg§! itself has led to it gleaming brightly as the Gem of the Urals. While dysfunctional, §WOrenburg§! nevertheless represents the achievements of the Russian people even in this dark stage of their history. To the north sits the §WUral League§!, the paramilitary children of Vorkuta, who, after the union of both guards and prisoners in the 50s, have dedicated themselves to protecting the week and needy of Russia.\n\nTo their south, however, lies the §WDirlewanger Brigade§!. They are dastardly bandits, the result of in-fighting in the §RGerman§! ranks during the §WWest Russian War§!, Dirlewanger and his crew of only the most depraved criminals from the SS and Eastern Europe having carved themselves out a petty fiefdom in what was once §WOrsk§!. Their goal? §WOrenburg§!, and the great loot contained within. But he is not alone in this desire, for §WTrofim Lysenko§!, petty warlord of §WMagnitogorsk§!, also looks hungrily westward. The maddened remainder of the Soviet science program with his own pet army in the §W22nd Motor Rifle NKVD§!, §WLysenko§! plots his eventual invasion of §WOrenburg§! for the perfect opportunity to collect thousands of test subjects to create a secret weapon... a super soldier army capable of defeating the §RGermans§!.\n\nWhile §WOrenburg§! and §WThe Ural League§! will make natural allies in their defense against the bandits, §WLysenko§! is a pragmatist, and so is §WDirlewanger§!. It is likely that pacts will form, but the question is ultimately what to do once they outlast their use... and what to do if forces outside of the Urals some day come knocking to their door.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n- A §Wshort§!, five year game, aimed at defeating the opposing two (or three) factions in the Urals.\n\n- §WUnify§! the communes of Orenburg or handle Lysenko's waning §Wsanity§!, §Wravage§!

 REGIONAL_INFO_AFRICA: "§G==SOUTHERN AFRICA==\n\n§!From the Sahara's fringes to the Cape of Good Hope, Central and Southern Africa simmers with the aftershocks of conflicts both old and new. The §WReich's§! resurgence has not left the §YDark Continent§! untouched; its talons have gouged a sea out of its heartland, and its sons hold sway over a dominion past two thousand miles from end to end. But the glorious years have passed §WGermania§!. Now its grip loosens with every day that bickering paralyzes the Volkshalle.\n\nNot all has fallen to the fascist menace, however. At the continent's tip burns defiant the §WUnion of South Africa§!, among the old empire's last dominions across the seas - certainly the last of what had once stretched from Cape Town to Cairo. Its fortunes have waned since the war's end; with Namibia torn from its grasp and its own people split in three loyalties, Africa's last democracy flickers and wanes amidst incessant threats of secession, rebellion, and invasion. Nevertheless, the Union's men hold firm along the Orange River's banks, steeling themselves with the certitude of a death in defense of their homes.\n\nFor to their north stands a triumvirate of Africa's most powerful men: §YReichskommissars Wolfgang Schenck§!, §YSiegfried Müller§! and §YHans Hüttig§!, viceroys of a third each of the Reich's Mittelafrikan conquests. Though cartographers depict their lands as one contiguous stretch of pitch black the same shade as the Heimat's, each §WReichskommissariat§! cannot be any more different from the rest. Companies and mercenaries the world over loot §WZentralafrika's§! vast wealth unheeded as §YMüller§! eagerly plans his next hunting expedition. §YSchenck§! and his Luftwaffe dance among the clouds far above §WSüdwestafrika§!, heedless of the troubles plaguing his subjects below.\n\nOnly §YHüttig§!, master of the Dark Continent's true Aryan bastion and overseer of a million slaves, casts a frigid eye beyond §WOstafrika's§! borders. Few but his closest advisors can divine the plans lurking in the zealot's mind; with his tendencies, fewer bet they will bring the continent anything but misery and grief.\n\nIt is 1962, and the §WNew Order§! frays at its edges. Old enmities resurge as a thousand plans spring into action. Circumstance binds three desperate eagles into one hesitant, tenuous alliance. Far in the distance, like a thunderous tempest, war comes to spill blood onto the savannah's sands once more.

The recent disastrous §MAmerican§!-backed §RGuairá Falls Invasion§! in §hParaguay§! is just one example of the current shift in the age-old conflict, that of §dforeign superpowers treating the continent as their personal sandbox§!, and old rivalries are still at play in defining the geopolitical order of South America, be it in the Chaco or the Andes.\n\nThe §MAmericans§! try to consolidate their sphere of influence in the region, relying on subterfuge, humanitarian aid, and political influence, while the §eJapanese§!, §rGermans§!, and even §nItalians§! attempt to break down the door any way they can.

 MOD_FEATURES_TEXT_1: "§W================\n==MOD FEATURES==\n================§!\n\n§Y==ECONOMICS==§!\n§WThe New Order: Last Days of Europe§! features a complex §Weconomy§! mechanic. You can access your economic overview by clicking upon the §Wdollar sign§! in between the §Wproduction§! and §Wconstruction§! tabs. The foundation of your national economy is your §GGDP§!, which will be the key to the economic prosperity of your state. Your §GGDP§! needs to be balanced out with your §Rdebt§!. Every year, interest upon your §Rdebt§! will be deducted as an expense, and ending up with too high of a §RDebt§! to §GGDP§! ratio could spell financial ruin.\n\nTo avoid troubling economic times, keep a watchful eye upon your §Gincome§! and your §Yexpenditures§!. Your §Gincome§! is determined by multiple factors, the most obvious of which being your §GGDP§!. Many other factors come to play, however, such as your industry, poverty rate, academia, and much more! On the other hand, you have your §Yexpenditures§!, the bane of any economist. §YExpenditures§! are a measure of factors such as military upkeep, social securities, construction projects, and more.\n\nIn §WThe New Order§!, balance is key. Reckless §Yexpenditure§! can swiftly lead to high levels of §Rdebt§!, which can in time spiral into insolvency and §Reconomic meltdown§!. On the other hand, a carefully and cleverly guided economy can result in high levels of §GGDP growth§!, comfortable monetary reserves, and a bright future for your nation.\n\n§Y==CUSTOM GUIs==§!\nMany of the countries in §WThe New Order§! feature expansive §GCustom GUIs§! designed to add more depth to your §Rgameplay experience§!, and make peacetime gameplay more interactive. §GDecision Custom GUIs§! are built directly into the §Ydecisions tab§!, and can be accessed simply by opening the tab. This includes the §WTomsk Duma GUI§!, the §WSouth African Referendum GUI§!, and §Rmany§! others!\n\nOn the other hand, §GFull Custom GUIs§! are accessed via the §Ypolitics tab§!, using a button located below your §Wcountry leader's portrait§!, next to the §WHead of Government's portrait§!. These §GFull Custom GUIs§! tend to be much more in-depth, and are oftentimes vital to a country's §Rgameplay experience§!. This includes the §WUnited States Voting GUI§!, the §WSpeer Zollverein GUI§!, the §WJapan Legislature GUI§!, and §Rseveral§! others. Furthermore, most §GCustom GUIs§! also feature an §Yinfo button§!, which, when §Rhovered over or clicked on§!, will display helpful information on how the interface works and other features of the §Rintegrated mechanic§!.\n\n§Y==OVERHAULED WAR==§!\n§RWar§! features heavily in §WThe New Order: Last Days of Europe§!. Players lead a military of the Cold War. Units have been nearly completely overhauled from Hearts of Iron IV. Helicopters and Air Cavalry ease ground attack and troop movement, and new tech trees devoted to §RAir Cavalry§! warfare have been developed. Armor featured in the mod is modern, with §GMBTs§! taking the mainstage on the battlefield and an entirely new armor setup. Players, however, should not forget about infantry and mobile infantry technologies. Armor and air technologies are no replacement for boots on the ground!\n\nOn the coasts, new naval technologies like §Rmodern aircraft carriers and stealth ships§! control the seas. TNO's reworked naval tech uniquely reflects the dynamic nature of warfare in the Cold War. In the air, the player may advance in bomber and fighter technologies that have been added to simulate the unstable world and wars of The New Order.\n\nPerhaps the most important decision any player must make is the future of their §Rmilitary doctrines§!. The introduction of long guerilla wars changed how wars were not just thought about, but fought. The blitz of the Second World War is no more, replaced by long slogs in hostile terrain. Victory is no longer a certainty, and a player's choices must reflect this. §ROrders of Battles§! have been changed and units shifted around to reflect this reality. §WThousands of new generals§! have been added to give the player a diversity of characters to lead their armies."

On the contrary, war is actually §Gextremely common§! and you will fight several as almost every nation. However, wars are not expressed through direct conflict, but instead normally as §RProxy Wars§!. §RProxy Wars§! are wars between two nations, who are backed by two larger nations using their conflict as a way to battle one another without an outright battle. These can also occur during §RCivil Wars§!, which are also exceedingly common.\n\nDuring a §RProxy War§!, nations at war with one another may find themselves being supported by an outside power. If nobody is playing as the backing power, then units will be gifted to the nation fighting the war. If a player is the backing power, however, they will be able to support their side via the §WVolunteer System§! as in vanilla §WHearts of Iron IV§!.\n\nBe careful however! Proxy wars are dangerous prospects, and can rapidly increase the §WDEFCON§! level! §R'Diplomatic Crisis'§! may be common, and possibly influenced by external actors. One wrong move, and you can cause global destruction.\n\n§Y==DIPLOMATIC CRISIS==§!\n§RDiplomatic Crisis§! are randomly fired throughout the duration of many wars and §RProxy Wars§!. A §RDiplomatic Crisis§! is an event chain showing an increase in tension that can escalate to full on global war. Traditionally, this means an event is fired for one §Wparticipant§! in a conflict, allowing them to take some form of loss by backing down from the crisis or gain by pushing against the other power. The defending power will then get the opportunity to do the same, and escalate further or back down. This continues for some time, with the reward increasing but alongside the loss, until one side buckles and backs down. If no side backs down, §Rthis will spark war between both sides!§!\n\n§RDiplomatic Crisis§! become more common the higher the §WDEFCON§! level is, and can also be fired during peace time! Remember to put the safety of the world before pride, or to exploit the game of powers in order to encourage the conflict...\n\n§G==NARRATIVE==§!\n§WThe New Order§! and its demo are a §Gnarrative§! based mod. This means that the mod is more story based than any other for §WHearts of Iron IV§!\n\nWhat this really means is that the gameplay loop of §GHearts of Iron IV§! is very different from the one of §WThe New Order§!. Gone is the linear build up towards a war with the option to choose an ideology before then, with an occasional event fired to give you a small boost. Instead, you will be navigating a country much like a §W'Choose Your Own Adventure'§! novel. While there will be plenty of opportunity for war, gameplay decisions, and many many nations have their own mechanics to learn, ultimately the feeling is one of playing a story.\n\nSo please, sit back, relax and enjoy the story while you work through your country. Paths should generally be self explanatory and if you find yourself overly confused please let us know and we'll see what we can do to make it easier in the future. We don't anticipate too much issue though, so enjoy the game, and let us know what you think!"
