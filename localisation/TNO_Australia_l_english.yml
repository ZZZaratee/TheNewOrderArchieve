#Ideas
AST_1961_Recession:0 "The 1961 Recession"
AST_1961_Recession_desc:0 "Too many loans, not enough capital. Labor had set the stage with their ruinous policies, their nationalizations and welfares, their wanton misuse of money the government simply did not have. From there the economy pirouetted into a death spiral as investors leave and creditors tighten their pockets. The camel toppled over in 1961, and so began the worst economic crisis in Australia's history since the Great Depression."

AST_1961_Recession_Austerity:0 "The 1961 Recession"

AST_White_Australia_Policy:0 "White Australia Policy"
AST_White_Australia_Policy_desc:0 "The Land Down Under has always been under assault long before the Rising Sun had made its terrible debut. Every poor, dirty Asian that steps foot on Sydney Harbor is one more threat to the Australian way of life -- its prosperity, its freedoms, its culture, its faith. West and East differ too much for one to coexist with the other; thus, it is for their sake, as much as it is for ours, that the government spare every effort towards keeping Australia white."

AST_White_Australia_Policy_Initial_Relief:0 "White Australia Policy"

AST_Looming_Japanese_Empire:0 "Looming Japanese Threat"
AST_Looming_Japanese_Empire_desc:0 "I'm telling ya', right outside a stone's throw from Darwin is the Jap just waiting for us to fuck up so they can come swooping in and butcher us to the last man! We've already been caught by our bloody knickers down in New Guinea, and what did that get us? Fifty thousand funerals, is what! All this shite about harmless this, peace that -- well 'Never Another Moresby', I say! NEVER ANOTHER MORESBY!"

AST_Looming_Japanese_Empire_Plan:0 "A Plan For Japan"

AST_Unpopular_Draft:0 "Unpopular Draft"
AST_Unpopular_Draft_desc:0 "Draft an Australian to protect the continent and he will give his life without a second thought. Draft an Australian to protect the Free World and he will grumble lightly, before marching off to wherever he is needed. Draft an Australian for no good reason, however, and the first thing on his mind will be "What am I lugging twenty bloomin' pounds of kit for, then?" Indeed, this question has been asked by many such Australians as of late, as opposition to the National Service Act grows by the day..."

#Intro
AST_Holts_Mandate:0 "Holt Secures His Mandate!"
AST_Holts_Mandate_desc:0 "With victory in the Australian elections, Harold Holt faces an Australia in uncharted waters - beset by a recession, burdened by its insistence on the White Australia policy, and saddled with being the last bastion of freedom in the Co-Prosperity Sphere's backyard. There's barely enough time to settle into the official residence before Holt has to face the masses."

AST_Initial_Drift_Towards_Austerity:0 "Initial Steps Towards Austerity"
AST_Initial_Drift_Towards_Austerity_desc:0 "It pains any red-blooded Australian to admit it, but ever since the collapse of the United Kingdom and the OFN embargo with official trade with Japan, Australia simply doesn't have the markets it used to for supporting its unproductive exporters. It won't be popular in the aftermath of the recent droughts, but the government can no longer spend excess cash on supporting industries whose markets have long since dried up."

AST_Work_With_Finance_Ministry:0 "Work With The Finance Ministry"
AST_Work_With_Finance_Ministry_desc:0 "Nursing Australia's economy back to health will mean nothing if future governments can open the taps again with abandon. Stable economic stewardship is the name of the game, and Holt knows a few people at the Department of Finance who agree. Together, Australia can come up with some medium-term rules to govern how money is to be spent by the government, setting the rules of the game for all who follow. It might also entice foreign investors who otherwise might have avoided business at the far edge of freedom..."

AST_Combating_This_Recession:0 "Combating This Recession"
AST_Combating_This_Recession_desc:0 "Now that the government has some fiscal breathing room and the foreign investors are courting Australia again, Holt pledges to use of every dollar in the budget to fight the recession head-on. The people and the land of Australia are rich in slumbering wealth... but only if the recession is vanquished once and for all."

AST_White_Australia_Policy_Must_Go:0 "White Australia Policy Must Go!"
AST_White_Australia_Policy_Must_Go_desc:0 "Arthur Calwell might be a flaming racist, but one of his policies wasn't wrong per se - that Australia, a nation of ten million souls facing of a Co-Prosperity Sphere of nearly a billion, must populate or perish. Calwell's mistake, though, was hoping for 'the right kind' of New Australian to come - the collapse of the British Empire and the closing of Europe's borders by the German puppet governments has meant that expecting white migration to Australia is as unrealistic as it is immoral. To survive, Australia must open its arms wider - the White Australia Policy must go."

AST_Loosen_Quotas:0 "Loosen Quotas"
AST_Loosen_Quotas_desc:0 "The first step to changing Australia's immigration policy is simple - we will loosen immigration quotas on migrants from all nations, chipping away at the walls surrounding Australia without regard for race or origin. The economic rationale is strong enough that opposition will be muted for now, but we can expect push back if we choose to dismantle White Australia further in the future."

AST_Australia_Doesnt_Discriminate:0 "Australia Does Not Discriminate"
AST_Australia_Doesnt_Discriminate_desc:0 "Australia is a nation of migrants - and the nation's future will be built by migrants. With the preferential policies of the White Australia Act removed and a gradual loosening of immigration quotas underway, making it clear to the world that Australia will not discriminate based on race or origin is not only the moral thing to do, but will serve as a powerful symbol for anyone who yearns to escape tyranny in Asia. And where better to start than by taking care of matters at home with the Aborigines..."

AST_Reaffirm_OFN_Ties:0 "Reaffirm OFN Ties"
AST_Reaffirm_OFN_Ties_desc:0 "Australia has always stood for freedom - and as the only free nation in the Western Pacific, we continue to face off warily against Japan and its Co-Prosperity Sphere. Australia cannot afford to isolate itself - we must continue to deepen our ties, economic and military, with the rest of the Organization of Free Nations, supporting its initiatives so that it will support us in our hour of need."

AST_Assist_Indonesian_Rebels:0 "Planning For War With Japan"
AST_Assist_Indonesian_Rebels_desc:0 "'It's better to have a plan and not need it, than to need it and not have it."  It has been nearly twenty years since the end of the war with Japan, with momentous changes in technology and military doctrine - to say nothing of the geopolitical situation Australia now finds itself in. The Australian defense establishment needs to conduct a net assessment to make sure that Australia has the means and the methods to remain free in a dark and dangerous world..."

AST_Summit_With_Nixon:0 "Summit With Nixon"
AST_Summit_With_Nixon_desc:0 "Ever since the collapse of the United Kingdom, the United States has been the guarantor of Australia's security, reflected in the close relationship between the two countries and their common membership in the OFN. With Australia deepening its ties with the rest of the OFN and actively preparing to counter the Japanese threat in the Pacific, it might be time for Prime Minister Hold to visit President Nixon to discuss their common interests in Oceania..."

AST_Discussing_Our_Coalition:0 "Discussing Our Coalition"
AST_Discussing_Our_Coalition_desc:0 "Tensions between the Liberal - Country coalition continue to mount as the Australian Liberal Party's growing cohort of urban voters pulls the coalition's center of gravity away from the rural interests of the National Country Party. The leader of the NCP, John McEwen, has insisted that the leadership of the two parties meet to discuss urgent matters..."

AST_Talks_Succeed:0 "Talks Succeed!"
AST_Talks_Succeed_desc:0 "The Coalition survives, and the ship of state sails onward. "

AST_Selecting_A_Cabinet:0 "Our Platform?"
AST_Selecting_A_Cabinet_desc:0 "With McEwen pledging the NCP's ongoing support, the question now turns to the political platform with which the Coalition will contest the next elections. While the Holt-McEwen meetings have made some agreements in principle, the detailed strategy of convincing Australians to re-elect the Coalition remains undecided."

AST_Forming_A_Majority_Government:0 "Forming A Majority Government"
AST_Forming_A_Majority_Government_desc:0 "Australia will be led into the future under the steady hand of the Coalition, with its vision of the future endorsed by its stable parliamentary majority. With the grand vision of the Coalition in place, the machinery of government marches onwards as bills are passed and new programs implemented."

AST_Talks_Fall_Through:0 "Talks Fall Through!"
AST_Talks_Fall_Through_desc:0 "Australia awakens to a political order turned upside down - the Coalition is no more."

AST_Peel_Away_Rightist_Labor:0 "Searching For Support"
AST_Peel_Away_Rightist_Labor_desc:0 "A government with no majority is no government at all. With the death of the Coalition, Prime Minister Holt scrambles to assemble enough support to ensure his government's survival, a task that will push him to call a truce with old enemies - or to divide the opposition so thoroughly that the Coalition's breakup looks positively amicable."

AST_Forming_A_Minority_Government:0 "Forming A Minority Government"
AST_Forming_A_Minority_Government_desc:0 "The Australian people will have a government that represents its varied interests, with individual legislation becoming the key focus of debate as alliances are forged and forgotten daily in Canberra. It is a rambunctious style of government - but perhaps this way, everyone will walk away with something they want, even if nobody can get everything they hoped for."

AST_Advance_Australia_Fair:0 "Advance Australia Fair!"
AST_Advance_Australia_Fair_desc:0 "As the political dust settles in Canberra, the world watches as the last bastion of hope in the Pacific rouses itself from a long torpor. The torch of freedom still burns bright in the Antipodes!"


#Liberal Economy I
AST_A_New_Economy_For_Australia:0 "A New Economy For Australia"
AST_A_New_Economy_For_Australia_desc:0 "The Coalition had won a tense, narrow victory over Labor in 1961 by riding the waves of popular discontent over an economy in freefall. With a promise to restore confidence in government and stability in the economy, we had gained the mandate of the Australian people and broke Labor's six-year hold over the country.\n\nNow that Canberra is theirs, however, a problem once papered over by political necessity rears its ugly head: The Coalition still could not agree on how to address the recession. Proposals have been drafted of course, but party politics being what it is, none of them have accrued enough support to establish themselves as the definite consensus.\n\nThe Liberal Party believes that a combination of jobs programs funded by deficit spending will kickstart the economy by encouraging Australians to spend, rather than hoard, their money. Meanwhile, their counterparts in Country believe that a threefold approach is the most suited to the job: Dismantling Labor's past reforms, liberalizing Australian industry from socialist inefficiency, and spreading the country's hoarded wealth to its forgotten corners and livelihoods.\n\nYet a third option exists, one that has lately gained increasing traction from both faction: Rather than wasting even more money, or disrupting the economy with mass privatizations, the government should instead focus on balancing its untenable budget and cutting on excesses and needless expenses whenever needed.\n\nWhichever plan our newly-formed government shall decide upon, we must decide posthaste. Every day we spend on bickering is a day wasted on doing nothing -- and the Australian people are not so kind as to forgive a government which breaks its promises."

AST_The_Liberal_Platform:0 "The Liberal Platform"
AST_The_Liberal_Platform_desc:0 "Formed from the nucleus of the late United Australia Party, the Australian Liberal Party had presented itself as the Coalition's more flexible wing, economically-speaking. Whereas the old codgers in Country remain staunch advocates of an unrestricted market, Liberals believe that the market must remain subordinate to the cause of national development, and that the state's occasional interference is the best means with which to ensure such a state of affairs. The urgency for such is more pronounced now than ever before, as Australia faces its greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nBy coopting the Liberals' economic platform, Parliament will dedicate Australia's shrinking budget towards establishing work program after work program and subsidizing business after business, encouraging the flow of money from household to market and back. Once this delicate cycle is restored, so too will the recession end and fade from memory."

POLITICS_HAROLD_HOLT_DESC:0 "For Harold Edward Holt, the recent nomination to become the prime minister of the Australian republic has been the last achievement of a long and accomplished career in politics. Born into a land owning family in Sydney, Holt entered politics at a young age as a member of the Young Nationalists, the youth wing of the United Australia Party, and was elected to parliament at the age of 27, making him the youngest MP at the time. Quickly becoming a protégé of Robert Menzies, Holt continued his career during wartime and rose through the ranks of the Liberal Party of Australia, the newly formed successor of the UAP.\n\nThe war proved to be an immense shock for the Australian nation. In what would turn out to be a pointless war ending in a bitter defeat, the country lost a generation of her brave young men, and as the Japanese sun rose over the Pacific, Australia was irredeemably scarred by its burning rays. Amidst cries for change and a deep political crisis, Canberra cut her ties to London just as Nazi troops completed the occupation of England, thus giving birth to the Republic of Australia. The politics of the young republic were dominated by the Labor Party, but soon Holt rose to the forefront of the opposition, eventually becoming the leader of the Liberal Party.\n\nEventually, the Liberal Party gained enough popularity to reach victory in the 1961 elections, with Holt being finally proclaimed prime minister. Promising to reaffirm the country's ties to the OFN, both economically and militarily, and to finally stabilize the country's economy while also ending the White Australia policy once and for all, Holt won over the nation with his reformist platform - however, only time will tell if his vision of a free, prosperous and fair Australia will be destined to become reality."

POLITICS_ARTHUR_CALWELL_DESC:0 "Ideas gain and lose favor with a man as he grows and learns in time's passage. For one Arthur Calwell, none had weathered its ravages better than those uttered by the great men that had come before him. The words they carried he tended diligently, from the sunny streets of old, sepia-toned Melbourne to the hallowed halls of Parliament House. From childhood to leaderhood of the esteemed Labour Party, with which he plans to see it realized across all the land.\n\nMany have derided the man for his staunch faith in that simple idea. "Outdated" they called its words, once uttered wholeheartedly by the humble workers and noble statesmen of his father's time. The idea itself, ill-fitted for a new chapter in Australia's history. But one need only read a history book to know that the need for it -- for a pure, unsullied Australia -- remains alive and well. For had not the moneyed fatcats flooded the land of their birth with a horde of Asian labour, sought to break the Australian worker? Had not the yellow devils dyed New Guinea with Australian blood, sought to break the Australian spirit? Had not Australia triumphed against both with the strength of her true-blooded sons, stood alone to resist against all odds?\n\nThese questions, and many more, were what all Australians had asked themselves after the War. In the days and years that followed, more Australians flocked to the banner of Labour with a resounding "Yes!" in their lips and his name in their prayers. So it was that the party, under his leadership, approached 1961. Jubilant, buoyed by a wave of support from all walks of life, and ready to steer Australia back on track... Which made the Liberals' victory all the more shocking, and their own defeat all the more bitter.\n\nBut let it not be said that Arthur Calwell is a quitting man. As long as he remains the face of Labour, the bloke from Melbourne will fight tooth and nail and rally the people under that beautiful idea in the elections to come. That idea he has long carried is the whisper of all good sons of his country, and their last hope in a world gone mad. White Australia will return triumphant, this he swore, or he will die trying."
