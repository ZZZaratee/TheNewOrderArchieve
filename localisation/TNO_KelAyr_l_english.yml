 AYR_idea_sahelian_nomads: "Sahelian Nomads"
 AYR_idea_sahelian_nomads_desc: "The Aïr mountains lie at the heart of the Sahel, the arid borderland that stretches between the great desert to the north and the rolling savannas to the south. This rugged, dry region is hostile to life, and only the hardiest species can survive in it. The nomadic tribes of the region have made it their home all the same, mastering the art of surviving where few others could."
 AYR_idea_tuareg_heritage: "Tuareg Heritage"
 AYR_idea_tuareg_heritage_desc: "The Sultanate of Aïr is not a nation so much as it is a tribal confederation, an alliance of the Tuareg tribes of the southwestern Sahara. The government isn't decentralized, it simply doesn't exist. Individual tribes roam the desert, migrating across the sands as they have done for centuries. Without significant reform and centralization, Aïr will never be remembered as anything other than a temporarily unclaimed region of western Africa."
 
 POLITICS_IBRAHIM_IBN_UMARU_DESC: "To the foreigner, the desert that surrounds the Air plateau is nothing but an inhospitable wasteland. But for the people who live there, who cross the desert with nothing but a camel and a mantle on their backs, the desert is more than a home. It's a place of plenty for the Touaregs and a fortress that repels the invader. Sultan Ibrahim ibn 'Umaru knows this very well, and that is why he and his people survived even as the German bombers dominated the air and destroyed the cities.\n\nAs civilization crumbled under Nazi bombs, the Sultan took his chance to retreat in the desert with his people and a few refugees. There he waited, biding his time while keeping himself and his people hidden from danger. When the sky was finally free from the bombers, the sultan immediately went to Agadez, the city where his ancestor once ruled, to declare the restoration of the Sultanate of Kel Ayr, by the grace of Allah and His prophet Muhammad, and quickly reasserted his rule over the Air region.\n\nThe Sultanate of Kel Ayr is just like his leader: a bastion of Islam and tradition devoted to the defense of its people against any external threat, be it European colonizers or African progressives. The foreigners might protest this, call it "oppression" or "fascism", but the Touaregs know that without the Sultan's guidance not only they would not be free, they would still struggle under anarchy. If today the people of the Air plateau enjoy order and peace they owe it all to the Sultan and the Sahara, the two shields against the dangers coming from the outside world."
