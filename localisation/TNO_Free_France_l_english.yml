 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_CHARLES_DE_GAULLE_DESC:0 "Since there has been a "Free France", Charles de Gaulle has stood at its helm. For more than 20 years, de Gaulle has led the last remaining Free French in a desperate and drawn out battle for survival against the greatest odds. He was once a division commander in the army of the Fourth French Republic, keen to bring reform to their forces. His attempts were made too late however and France quickly fell the Wehrmacht.\n\nKeen to continue the fight, de Gaulle rallied what support he had and headed to Africa. Although the fighting continued, de Gaulle fared little better here. Over the years, the forces of Free France were relentlessly pursued across Africa until only the tiniest strip of what had once been the colonial possessions of the French Republic remained. Through it all, de Gaulle has been both a great boon and a great curse for those that still follow the dream of a Free France. The man is utterly convinced of "La Libération" to the point where it is hard not to share in the aging leader's sheer enthusiasm. Sadly, his conviction is paired with an extreme stubbornness. de Gaulle is unwilling to end the unpopular military government, despite the fact that his generals are usually too busy working as mercenaries for other West African nations and even the Germans in Zentralafrika.\n\nde Gaulle soldiers on, making his radio addresses and inspecting the troops each day, seemingly convinced that it will be part of the start of their journey home. He has even promised elections, although with the deadline drawing ever nearer, some are uncertain if de Gaulle is willing to even surrender that much to the people. Nor has he properly acknowledged the generals that wish to see him gone, and the fact they would be quite capable of having their wish fulfilled. de Gaulle must perhaps realise his situation and be willing to make compromises, should he wish to see his homeland ever again."
 POLITICS_CHARLES_DE_GAULLE_DESC1:0 "Everywhere outside of Free France. De Gaulle is seen as a failure. He failed to rouse his country from its darkest point. He failed to assist in the war effort. He failed France. But that is just outside Free France. In Free France he is a hero, albeit a fading one. Nobody can deny his charisma and optimism, and he has used it to the greatest extent he can in the tiny empire he has carved for himself. In his France, through all the troubles it goes through, they still march through the streets, singing La Marseillaise and chanting "Liberté, égalité, fraternité"\n\nIf there is one thing anybody can give credit to Charles De Gaulle for, its that he never gives up on France, and he won't till he takes his last breath."

 FFR_military_administration_desc: "Our current situation has forced Charles de Gaulle to put under military control most of our territory.

While it is an efficient method, this prevent us from knowing what is happening in the rest of the nation, and is leaving a lot of power in the hands of our generals."

One which in their hands, will be guided towards our greater goal.\n\nOur victory is within sight."

While our armed hand on the continent is still the Résistance, even here in the deep lands of the Ivory Coast, we still fight for our ideals. Through the Comet Line, exiles were sent here from France and Belgium, believing in the all powerful nature of democracy and freedom, fighting for their country, even across oceans."

The Belgian resistance movement was a great help in France's struggle, and when the war was over De Gaulle proposed to the Belgians to come in Free France until Belgium, in exchange of promising the liberation Belgium right after liberating France. After more than 15 years of exile the Belgian political status is still undetermined, and the Belgians are urging the Free French government to find a solution."
