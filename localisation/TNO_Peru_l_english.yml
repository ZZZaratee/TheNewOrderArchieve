  PRU_Ricardo_Elias_sec: "Ricardo Elías Aparicio"

  ##### Ministers Description ######
  PRU_Carlos_Moreyra_hog_desc: "------------\n§LBorn in 1898, Moreyra is an engineer and politician. He served under Prado as Minister of Development and Public Works, where he disagreed with Prado's policy of playing both sides during WW2. Postwar, he worked in the Agrarian National Society until Prado's return to Peru in 1956. As keeping the door open for Japan lost Prado support from the landowners, Moreyra convinced him to join the ACDN, and became Prado's second vice president. After Beltrán criticized Prado's government, Moreyra mediated, and Beltrán became Minister of Economics and President of the Council of Ministers, or Premier. Following Beltrán's resignation, Moreyra took over as Premier, and remains a close friend of Prado.§!"
  PRU_Alvarado_Garrido_pol_desc: "------------\n§LBorn in 1907, Alvarado Garrido has been a lawyer and diplomat for a record 40 years, teaching in the UNMSM and PUCP as a professor, and served as ambassador to Bolivia in the 1950s. His long and stellar career has impressed Prado, who appointed him Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1960. Alvarado is tasked with dealing with the Ecuadorians, and keeping good relations with the US and Japan.§!"  
  PRU_Gallo_Porras_eco_desc: "------------\n§LBorn in 1894, Gallo Porras is one of Peru's most outstanding politicians. His post as mayor of Miraflores and Lima during the 1930s gave him invaluable experience. He joined the ACDN in 1955, and was Prado's running mate in the 1957 elections. After Beltrán resigned as Minister of Economy and Finance, Gallo took his place, and continues to be one of Prado's closest friends in these trying times.§!"
  PRU_Ricardo_Elias_sec_desc: "------------\n§LBorn in 1906, Elías Aparicio is an experienced lawyer. Commissioned by the Benavides government in 1938 to investigate Germany and Italy's penal systems, Elías became interested in Peru's own penal system. This led him to later work for the military and police. Appointed Minister of Security by Prado in 1960, Elías is presently worried about the ominous silence in the north, and sporadic terrorism in the countryside.§!"

  ### Leader Description ### \n
  POLITICS_MANUEL_PRADO_UGARTECHE_DESC: "Born in 1889 to a wealthy family and son of ex-President Manuel Ignacio Prado, Manuel Prado Ugarteche is a civil engineer who became one of the major players in Peruvian politics during the 1940s and 50s. Rising through the ranks, he was tapped by President Oscar R. Benavides to be his successor, and won the 1939 election. Prado continued Benavides' suppression of the outlawed APRA and PCP. As the Nazis invaded Poland, Prado's government changed the course of Peru with a new foreign policy. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Prado publicly supported the US and the Allies to keep Peru's good relations with Washington, but he kept the door open for the Japanese as an option. By 1944, the war seemed undecided, yet the US still stood strong. So Prado kept his 'neutral' foreign policy, up until the fateful day that Pearl Harbor was erased in a flash of blinding light, and the US signed a conditional surrender to the Axis Powers.\n\nStunned by how the mighty northern giant had fallen, Manuel Prado was yet convinced that he had made the right choice, expecting that everything would remain normal. After his term ended, he left Peru for the US and Canada. He watched from afar as his homeland descended into chaos, then returned to a semblance of normality. That normality convinced him to return in 1956 to run for the 1957 elections, but he couldn't run without popular support. His close allies convinced him to form an alliance with Beltrán called the Alianza Conservadora Democrática Nacional and work with Manuel Odría. The fateful 'Pact of Monterrico' was sealed, where Prado would win the elections as the ACDN candidate, in exchange for sweeping Odría's corruption under the rug. In his second term, Prado lifted the National Security Law but kept the ban on the APRA and UR while releasing some of their most moderate members. He also worked successfully with Pedro Beltrán to stabilize the economy.\n\nIt's been five years since Prado became President, and yet so much more needs to be done. With elections looming, factionalism in the ACDN, the investment war, and the threat of APRA, Prado prepares to make his final moves before he leaves office. He will continue in his traditional tactic - that of doing nothing until everything goes back to normal. It has worked before, it will work again. §RRight?§!"

  #####  Ideas of Peru   ######
  #############################
  PRU_idea_fake_democratic_dream: "The False Dream"
  PRU_idea_fake_democratic_dream_desc: "On the surface, Peru appears to have a strong and healthy democracy. Of course, the truth's far more complex once you dig deeper. Democracy was restored in 1939 with the election of President Prado, only to face its hardest challenge with the Battle for Lima. Peruvian democracy triumphed, and the people believed it was finally strong enough... but rumors of electoral fraud in the 1950s under the Odría government hurt its image again, with accusations of a guiding hand always manipulating the voting polls.\n\nCan Peru achieve the long lasting dream of democracy, or will history repeat itself again? We must be careful attending this issue. If we fail, the dream dies, §Rand the people's faith in democracy with it.§! But if we succeed, §mdemocracy will be finally realized§!."
  PRU_idea_silent_liberation: "The Silent Liberation"
  PRU_idea_silent_liberation_desc: "After the Battle for Lima, the pro-APRA northern regions continued to rebel against the Bustamante and Odría governments, until one day they stopped... and there was only silence. Our soldiers report no firefights, our policemen confidently tell us that everything is under control, and the citizens continue as if nothing happened. But to Lima, this silence is a bad omen. We need to keep the north in check, §Rbecause we know that the Aprists are still there, hiding...§!"
  PRU_idea_two_super_powers_one_economy: "Two Superpowers, One Economy"
  PRU_idea_two_super_powers_one_economy_desc: "Since the signing of the Akagi accords and Prado opening up the economy to Japanese investment, there has been an economic investment war between America and Japan in Peru. Peru, in many political theorists' eyes, can be Japan's entry point into South America; accordingly, both nations have been heavily investing in Peru to achieve their objectives.\n\nInvestment from both the Rising Sun and the American Eagle was courted by various Presidents of Peru throughout the 50s, with President Odría attracting millions of yen of investment into Peru from Japan. American investment remains strong however as they are unwilling to let a single nation drift into Japan's sphere without a fight.\n\nThere are frequent American-Japanese economic clashes, especially in the Northwestern Industrial and Oil Refinery zones in Talara. If Peru can continue courting investment from both superpowers, they can expect riches to flow into the country. However with riches comes problems: inequality has risen with rich Japanese and American families taking large swaths of wealth from this investment and becoming as rich as Peru's upper class. While Peru is benefiting economically, there is a backlash amidst the working class of Peru which, if not dealt with effectively, could result in a return of violence in Peru."
  PRU_idea_peru_diverse_problems: "A Diverse Country with Diverse Problems"
  PRU_idea_peru_diverse_problems_desc: "Once the heart of the Incan Empire, our beautiful country is filled with different cultures and traditions, from our mestizos, to the foreign migrants, to the natives. But with just as many peoples comes just as many problems. The last governments and those before them have neglected agrarian reform, integration of the jungle, development of the Andean regions, and many more. Even the people protesting over all of these issues couldn't sway them to do something. We won't repeat their mistakes! Sooner or later, we'll address these problems once and for all. And if we succeed, §nwe will earn the people's lasting trust.§!"
