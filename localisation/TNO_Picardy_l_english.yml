 POLITICS_CHRISTIAN_MAZIERE_DESC:0 "In the center of what was once France, the Charlemagne Division struggles to re-assert their control- but there is no doubt who they'll back when they regain their footing.\n\nChristian de la Maziere is an odd bird, one of the few men in Burgundy who pledges themselves to the Reichsführer more out of a personal loyalty than a belief or obligation. Once a soldier in the French Army, Maziere has spent the last two decades working his way up the ranks of the Charlemagne Division, the predominant French collaborator division in the Waffen-SS. It was here where he first met Heinrich Himmler, and a loyalty to a man that most found disturbing at best formed as he moved higher and higher, becoming Commander of the division just as the Ordensstaat was founded. For years now, he has worked side by side in pursuit of the Spartanist ideal, even as worries rose about Himmler's disgust for the French culture that Maziere loved.\n\nBefore he could truly reflect on those worries, however, everything changed. The Führer died, eventually replaced by Heydrich- a best case scenario, and Maziere celebrated as such. For a brief moment in time, all seemed like it would work out after all- that is, until the new Führer suddenly broke from what the SS believed, denouncing Himmler with ridiculous accusations of apocalyptic dreams, and everything changed again- not for the better.\n\nCharlemagne was caught off guard by the sudden flip, and it shows. Maziere watches as his men scramble to re-assert their control over cities they hadn't bothered to pay attention to for a year. Though the initial situation seems dire, he has no fear- he knows that the right side will win in the end, and the Spartanist dream will be back on track. With no question of where his loyalty lies, it's a matter of when, not if, his forces will rejoin Himmler's and march off to war."

The Ordensstaat collapsed, and Himmler was no more able to project power- a best case scenario, and Maziere celebrated as such. For a brief moment in time, all seemed like it would work out after all- that is, until both the SS Langemarck and the Walloon Division went to war, and everything changed again- not for the better.\n\nCharlemagne was caught off guard by the sudden chaos, and it shows. Maziere watches as his men scramble to re-assert their control over cities they hadn't bothered to pay attention to for a year. Though the initial situation seems dire, he has no fear- he knows that the right side will win in the end, and the National Socialist dream will be back on track. With no question of where his loyalty lies, it's a matter of whether his forces will rejoin the French State ot the German Reich."

 POLITICS_CHRISTIAN_MAZIERE_COLLAPSE_DESC:0 "Standartenführer de la Mazière has long awaited this day - the day when the backstabbing swindler who calls himself Reichsführer would show his weakness. The purpose of the Charlemagne Division was to crush Judeo-Bolshevism, not serve a deluded, decrepit old mystic in the annihilation of their own people. That he was ever expected to do so was nothing short of an insult to the flower of French soldiery, who perished in the hundreds on the Eastern Front.\n\nPerhaps there are still good men in the Reich - Germans who would have comrades, rather than subjects - but that cannot be said for the Ordensstaat. Christian de la Mazière will take what is owed to the legion and more; first from the SS, then from the enemies of France. If Germany herself is among them, then so be it. As long as he lives to see Heinrich Himmler dangling from a noose beneath the Arc de Triomphe, he will be satisfied with his lot. Survival, with the promise of plunder and a purified France, is just a bonus."
 
 ## Ideas ##
 
 PIC_in_name_only:0 "In Name Only"
 PIC_in_name_only_desc:0 "Maziere's men bear the name of Charlemagne, but they are perceived by most Frenchmen as mere German bootlickers. He might see himself as the founder of a new France, but Maziere has a long way to go before his countrymen even consider showing respect."
 
 PIC_robber_barony:0 "The Robber Barony"
 PIC_robber_barony_desc:0 "The leaders of Charlemagne are wealthy men, but not due to any business acumen or hard-earned rewards. Their riches are almost uniformly stolen from others. Though they once restricted themselves to expropriated Jewish property, the officers are not above less patriotic ventures..."
